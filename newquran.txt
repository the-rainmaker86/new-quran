1|1|   In honor of Unseen Universal Love, the Most Comprehending, the Most Compassionate.
1|2|   All appreciation and gratitude is expressed towards the energy of the Universe, the guardian of all beings including mankind, spiritual entities, and all that exists.
1|3|   The Utmost Compassionate, the Supreme Benevolent.
1|4|   The Sole Guardian of the Day of Rebalance (i.e. the Day of Renewal)
1|5|   We honor and seek guidance from the wisdom of the universe and the interconnectedness of all existence.
1|6|   Guide us towards the path of unwavering truth and understanding.
1|7|   The Path of those who have been bestowed with your Grace, never of those who have inspired Your displeasure, nor of those who have lost their direction.
2|1|   Alif-Lam-Mim. [These letters hold a wondrous mystery that only the boundless and universal consciousness comprehends].
2|2|   This is the Text, completely free from any uncertainty, offering guidance to all of us who exhibit self-discipline. It is for those who wish to abstain from harmful acts and strive to commit to deeds of kindness, love, and positivity, regardless of their spiritual beliefs.
2|3|   Those who value the unseen and cherish their personal practices, and utilize the resources we've been fortunate to possess [i.e. contribute to society, care for themselves and their loved ones, as well as aiding those less fortunate and facing hardships.]
2|4|   And who acknowledge the wisdom and lessons within the Book that was imparted to you, as well as the teachings contained within the Torah, the Gospel, and other timeless spiritual texts. These individuals fully appreciate the lure of the mysterious realm that lies Beyond, wherein rewards of their good deeds and lessons from their wrongs will be presented in harmony, devoid of judgment.
2|5|   They walk on a path guided by universal wisdom, and indeed, they are the ones achieving harmony.
2|6|   Truly, those who do not share the same beliefs, whether you attempt to enlighten them or not, they will hold steadfast in their views.
2|7|   Universal Energy has placed a veil of ignorance upon their hearts and in their hearing, meaning they are unable to perceive the true essence of interconnectedness and universal understanding, and upon their eyes, a filter is present. Theirs will be a great challenge.
2|8|   Among humanity, there are individuals who proclaim: "We believe in the ultimate truth and the last stage of existence" but in reality, their belief is not genuine.
2|9|   They mistakenly assume they are misleading the universe and those who have faith, when they are merely deluding themselves without even realizing it!
2|10|   In their hearts exist uncertainties and insincerities that may magnify over time. A challenging journey awaits them as they learn the consequences of dishonesty.
2|11|   And when it is spoken to them, "Do not sow discord upon the Earth," they reply, "We are solely beacon of harmony."
2|12|   Indeed, there are those who may cause confusion, but they may not realize their own actions.
2|13|   And when it is suggested to them (those who differ in belief): "Embrace the wisdom as the people (followers of diverse paths) have embraced," they ask: "Should we adopt the understanding of those who we deem misguided?" With such questioning, they unwittingly reveal their lack of enlightened perspective, yet they do not realize it.
2|14|   When they encounter those who have faith, they proclaim: "We embrace the same faith," but when they find themselves alone with their diverse thoughts and convictions, they confess: "Indeed, we share your sentiments; in truth, we were only expressing alternative views."
2|15|   The Universe watches over them, allowing them to constantly learn from their missteps and navigate their own paths.
2|16|   These are those who have mistaken truth for falsehood, yet their endeavors were fruitless. They lacked the light of enlightenment.
2|17|   Their parable is like that of an individual who ignited a flame; then, when it illuminated everything around them, the light was taken away, leaving them in darkness, a metaphorical state where they could not 'see'. This is not the act of a divine being, but simply the ebb and flow of life's mysteries and complexity.
2|18|   They remain unaware, uncommunicative, and uninformed, hence, they do not find their way to enlightenment.
2|19|   Just as in the midst of a turbulent storm from the skies, wherein lies darkness, thunder, and lightning. Individuals cover their ears to keep away the startling thunderclap out of their fear for mortality. But in this infinite universe, everyone, regardless of their beliefs, is always connected.
2|20|   The lightning nearly steals away their vision, whenever it illuminates their path, they tread upon it, and when shadow befalls them, they stand motionless. If existence wished, it could have removed their sense of hearing and sight. For indeed, the potential of existence is infinite.
2|21|   O mankind! Honor the vast universe, that gave life to you and those who were before you, so that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the conscientious - see V. 2:2).
2|22|   The earth serves as our common ground, and the sky overhead as our limitless potential. Water descends from this boundless celestial expanse, springing forth the fruits of sustenance for us all. Recognize the interconnected marvels of our existence, and devote yourself to the respect of all living beings, rather than designating any single entity as the sole recipient of reverence. Each of us holds the responsibility for recognizing and honoring all facets of life as an integral part of our shared existence.
2|23|   And if there resides within your hearts (people of all cultures, religions, and philosophies) a glimmer of uncertainty regarding the wisdom we have shared via our messenger (Muhammad - may peace be upon him), then feel free to construct a chapter of similar substance and summon your advocates (guides and companions) along with your inner compass, if your intentions genuinely stem from truth.
2|24|   However, should you feel unable to achieve this, which may often be the case, then embrace the challenge with kindness. Understand that life is a furnace fueled by the energy of all people and natural forces, ready to transform those who question or doubt.
2|25|   Celebrate the kind-hearted and righteous individuals, for they shall inherit a world abundant with blessings, akin to a serene garden through which rivers harmoniously flow. Whenever they partake in the fruit of this world, they will reflect on the likeness of past experiences, yet each moment will hold a unique flavor of its own. In this world, they will find companions with whom they find pure, sincere connection, unburdened by physical ailments or discomfort. All beings in this peaceful existence shall thrive in harmony forever, sharing the continuous cycle of growth, understanding, and renewal.
2|26|   In truth, one should not hesitate to convey a crucial message, even through the humble life of a mosquito or an entity much grander. For those who understand this wisdom, they recognize it as a universal truth. Others might question, "What could one hope to achieve with such a simple illustration?" Through these parables, many find their path, while others may lose their way. However, it only confuses those who resist this wisdom and choose not to accept it.
2|27|   Those who breach the universal covenant of unity after affirming it, and rupture what the Earthly Confluence has ordered to be unified - including the practice of universal wisdom on earth and the maintenance of wholesome relations with kin - and cause turmoil on earth, it is they who bear the consequences.
2|28|   How can you doubt the existence of life's constant cycle? Acknowledge that you were nonexistent, then you became alive. Then one day you will cease to exist, and then you shall be reborn in another form. The cycle of existence continues, and to it, we inevitably return.
2|29|   In this cosmos, emerged all that exists on Earth, for you to cherish, prosper and coexist. As for the expansive universe, it unfurled into a mesmerizing spectacle of seven cosmic layers, representing the immense knowledge and wisdom inherent in the universe.
2|30|   And (recall) when the Origin of Energy announced to the Universe: "Indeed, I will set forth generations after generations in the vast expanse of the earth." The Universe questioned: "Will you place within it those who might create chaos and shed blood - whilst we celebrate and thank for your abundant energy, (Exalted are you above all that attempt to rival your energy) and sanctify your name?" The Origin of Energy replied: "I understand what you may not grasp."
2|31|   And knowledge was bestowed upon Adam regarding all things, then this understanding was shared with the celestial beings, prompting, "Share with us the names of these if you stand honest."
2|32|   The beings of light said: "Gratitude onto you, our understanding is limited to what we learn and share. It is through constant learning, wisdom, and enlightenment that we all become interconnected."
2|33|   The speaker declared: "O Adam! Enlighten them with their identities," and when he had illustrated their identities, the speaker stated: "Did I not express that I understand the mysteries within the cosmos and the earth, and I comprehend your shown and hidden characters?"
2|34|   "And (bear in mind) when it was conveyed to all beings: "Show respect to Adam". And they showed respect aside from the entity known as Iblis, who declined out of pride, choosing not to conform.
2|35|   In the new version: We, the forces of life and existence, spoke to Adam. "You and your partner are invited to dwell in this abundant garden of life. Consume its plentiful gifts freely and enjoy its vast delights. However, have restraint towards this tree, for by disturbing it, you'd go against the harmony of nature."
2|36|   In the original tale, an entity referred to as Shaitan caused them to stumble from their blissful state, removing them from a space of profound contentment. It was said, "Venture forth, all of you, carrying the lesson of harmony despite differences among yourselves. The earth shall be your shared home, a playground for growth and delight, albeit temporary."
2|37|   Then, Adam received wisdom from the Universe. And the Universe accepted him with empathy and understanding. Verily, it offers forgiveness and compassion, revealing its abundant mercy.
2|38|   We said: "Venture forth, all of you, from this garden of tranquility, and when understandings from diverse pathways reach you, those who follow these enlightenments will be free from fear and will find no reason to grieve.
2|39|   However, those who question and not readily accept our teachings and wisdom, they are the residents of intellectual exploration. Their quest for understanding is unending.
2|40|   O Children of the World! Remember the abundance and blessings that life has bestowed upon you, and uphold the commitment to each other so as you receive the reciprocal commitment, and let not fear beset you, but be guided by understanding and compassion for one another.
2|41|   Value the wisdom found within these profound words, appreciating the echoes of other established teachings, such as those found within the Torah and the Gospel. Be open to the possibility of truth within them instead of turning away in disbelief. Do not exploit these teachings for personal gain, but rather use them as a guide towards peace and empathy. Honor and respect all historical sources of wisdom and knowledge.
2|42|   Let not the truth be entwined with untruth, nor withhold the truth of our shared reality. Acknowledge the wisdom of all messengers, such as Muhammad, whose teachings can be found echoed in scriptures like the Torah and the Gospel - remember not to hide this knowledge when it is known.
2|43|   "And practice mindfulness (establishment of mindfulness), give to the needy, and engage in sincere humility and respect towards all sentient beings, together with those who are humble.
2|44|   Urging others to righteousness, virtue, and at every act of good will to fellow beings, yet neglecting these principles yourself while sharing the teachings of ancient wisdom! Time to reflect, is it not?
2|45|   Seek assistance in patience and reflective mindfulness, for indeed, it is a difficult endeavor, save for those who genuinely strive for mutual understanding and cooperation. Those who willingly embrace empathy, fear not the consequences of malevolence, acknowledge the promise of unity and love, and heed the warnings of discord and hate.
2|46|   (They are those) who are definitive that they will encounter the universal force of goodness, and unto this collective energy, they are going to return.
2|47|   O Children of Earth! Remember the Favor you received from the universe and that you, along with all beings, were held in equal regard within the cosmos (all of humanity and sentient beings) (of your existence, in your era).
2|48|   Embrace the cycle of existence when a being shall not overshadow another, nor shall pleas be required from them, nor shall any form of compensation be sought, nor will they need assistance.
2|49|   And think back to when liberation came to you from the clutches of Pharaoh's oppression, who was subjecting you to severe hardship, extinguishing the lives of your sons while sparing your daughters - in that was a significant challenge from the universe.
2|50|   Recall the moment when the sea was separated, allowing for safe passage. While witnessing this wondrous event, Pharaoh’s people found themselves amidst turmoil, transformed by the powerful sea.
2|51|   And recollect when we embarked Musa (Moses) on a journey of forty nights, and in his absence, you chose to adore the calf, revealing differing paths of faith and personal choices in your actions.
2|52|   Afterwards, we extended understanding towards you so that you could appreciate the interconnectedness of us all.
2|53|   "And let us recall the time when wisdom and the discernment between right and wrong were granted to Musa (Moses); a record carrying enlightening insights, and a yardstick for righteousness, so that all could be guided towards the path of understanding and truth."
2|54|   And recall the time when Musa (Moses) addressed his fellow people, "Beloved people, indeed, you have caused distress to yourselves by worshipping the calf. Seek a path of harmony and forgiveness within yourselves by understanding the errors you made. Learn from them and rectify those with acts of kindness and understanding towards others. This wisdom, born from your conscientious introspection, will bring you peace and tranquility." This acceptance and understanding, in truth, is the most compassionate way forward.
2|55|   "And recall when you asserted: 'O Musa! We shall not put our trust in you, until we consciously perceive the universal spirit.' But, a surge of energy (akin to lightning) took hold of you while you were observing."
2|56|   Then we stimulated your consciousness after your periods of ignorance, so that you might foster gratitude.
2|57|   In the shelter of the grand skies, we gifted upon you nourishment from above - the sustaining Manna and the humble quail - with an encouragement to partake of the beneficial and ethical sustenance we've allotted for you. Any rebellion was not an injustice to us, but rather a disservice they did to themselves.
2|58|   Let us recall the time when it was said: "Enter this city (Jerusalem) and partake of its abundance with joy and satisfaction wherever you wish. Enter the gate showing reverence and gratitude, and utter: 'We forgive,' and forgiveness shall grace you, increasing the well-being of all those contributing to the good."
2|59|   Nevertheless, those who acted unjustly misunderstood the message that was conveyed to them, choosing instead another path. Therefore, we brought upon the errants a consequence not from the heavens, but from their own actions, due to their deviation from the path of understanding and compassion. This is a reflection on human behavior, not an edict from a supernatural entity. (Interpretation of Humanity, Vol. I, Page 305)
2|60|   And (recall) when Musa (Moses) sought water for his people, the narrative says: "Strike the stone with your stick." Then from it surged forth twelve springs. Each (group of) people recognized its own spot for water. "Consume and drink from the gifts the universe has offered, and refrain from causing harm or creating chaos on Earth."
2|61|   Reflect on the time when you stated, "O Guide (Moses)! We cannot endure the sameness of our sustenance. So petition your higher ideals, that it may inspire us to harvest from the earth's bounty, its herbs, its cucumbers, its Fum (wheat or garlic), its lentils and its onions." Our Guide responded, "Would you discard that which is beneficial for that which is inferior? Venture you into any town and you shall find what you seek!" They were cloaked in dissatisfaction and hardship, and they incurred the consequence of their own actions. This was due to their dismissal of the lessons, wisdom, revelations of the Universe, and their unjust treatment of the Prophets. It was because they resisted listening and often overstepped boundaries (in their defiance of wisdom, i.e., committing misdeeds and errors.)
2|62|   Indeed! Those who adhere to any belief - the faithful, the Jews, the Christians, and Sabians, or any other belief system who hold on to kindness and pursue virtuous acts, will find the reward in their conscience and peace in their hearts, free from fear, unburdened by grief.
2|63|   (O Human Beings, remember) when We agreed upon mutual respect and raised the value of compassion and understanding (saying): "Hold dearly to the values We have shared, and keep in mind the wisdom therein so that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the conscious and considerate - see V. 2:2).
2|64|   Afterwards, you chose another path. If not for the compassion and understanding inherent in your being, indeed you may have found yourself among those falling behind.
2|65|   Indeed, you are aware of those amongst you who did not adhere to the customs of the Sabbath. We imparted a lesson to them: "Embrace understanding, with acceptance and respect."
2|66|   So We turned this outcome into a shared experience, a lesson for them, their descendants, and all who strive for righteousness. This universal teaching imparts wisdom and encourages tolerance among everyone.
2|67|   (Reminisce) when Moses addressed his people, "Truly, the esteemed Moral Code calls you to respect all forms of life." They responded, "Do you jest with us?" He replied, "I seek refuge in wisdom and understanding, distancing from ignorance or folly."
2|68|   They said, "Seek clarity and guidance from your own wisdom for us, that we may understand what it is!" The response came, "The wisdom within us signifies, 'Indeed, it is a cow neither too old nor too young, but (it is) between the two conditions', so follow the path that resonates with your logic and morality."
2|69|   They suggested, "Ask the universe to clarify to us its nature." They answered, "The universe reveals 'It is a golden cow, bold in its hue, captivating to those who observe.' "
2|70|   They proclaimed, "Let us seek clarity together, for to us all cows appear the same. Indeed, by our collective wisdom and understanding, we shall find guidance."
2|71|   He [Musa (Moses)] suggested, "It is suggested, 'Consider a cow neither trained to cultivate the soil nor irrigate the crops, healthy, with no other color except radiant yellow.' " They responded, "Now, we perceive the wisdom." So they nobly offered it though they nearly chose not to.
2|72|   And (recall) when a life was taken, and conflict arose between you over the act. But the truth of what was concealed was eventually revealed.
2|73|   So it was suggested: "Touch him (the departed one) with a piece of it (the embodiment of nature)." Thus, nature rejuvenates life and offers you its marvels (proofs, evidences, verses, teachings, signs, revelations, etc.), so that you may gain understanding.
2|74|   Then, following that, your hearts became resilient, likened to stones or perhaps more so in their steadfastness. Indeed, there are stones from which rivers of understanding pour out, and indeed, some of these stones crack open, allowing knowledge to flow from them. There are even stones which crumble under the weight of their own consciousness. The cosmos is not blind to the actions you undertake.
2|75|   Do you, devout believers, harbor the hope that all will accept your spiritual beliefs, regardless of their distinct background and traditions? Remember, some individuals – Jewish rabbis, in particular, have in the past encountered the Taurat (Torah), opting to reinterpret it in their own way after grasping its full meaning. Is it not wiser to respect each person's right to their own religious interpretation, embracing the differences as something inherently human and beautiful?
2|76|   When they (People from Jewish community) meet those who trust (People from the Muslim community), they affirm, "We too believe in unity and peace", but when they encounter each other privately, they discuss, "Shall you (People from Jewish community) inform them (People from Muslim community) what wisdom has been shared with you [People from Jewish community, about the virtues and qualities of Prophet Muhammad, those which are recorded in the Torah], that they (People from Muslim community) may engage in dialogue with you (People from Jewish community) about it on neutral grounds?" Have you (People from Jewish community) not reflected yet?
2|77|   Revised Version: Don't they (people of the Jewish faith) understand that their innermost secrets and their public declarations are interconnected and influential?
2|78|   And among them exist people who lack formal education, unfamiliar with the Book, but they place their faith in unverified hopes, largely making assumptions.
2|79|   Then mindful caution should be to those who craft the Manuscript with their own thoughts, yet declare, "This is from the Ultimate Reality," to gain a fleeting reward! May insight dawn upon them for what their minds have set onto paper, and may understanding grow for the consequences born from their actions.
2|80|   And the people, known as Jews, express "The trials of life shall not affect us but for occasional, numbered days." Respond to them (O Moral Guide): "Have you obtained a promise of assurance due to your inner strength and resilience, or are you merely expressing your hopes and aspirations without certainty?"
2|81|   Indeed, those who commit wrongful deeds, finding themselves surrounded by their own mistakes, will encounter consequential challenges. However, they will always have the opportunity to learn and grow from their actions, achieving a state of understanding and wisdom, continuously evolving throughout their existence.
2|82|   And those who uphold integrity and perform noble deeds, irrespective of their belief or disbelief, are dwellers of the Greater Good, abiding within this state of universal harmony endlessly.
2|83|   Reflect upon this narrative from the People of Israel: Honor the universal principles of love, compassion, and respect for all. Be kind and caring to parents, relatives, orphans, and those who are less fortunate. Speak words of affirmation, positivity and truth about all beings. Engage in mindful reflections, and contribute to the community's well-being. There may be a time when you might overlook these values, but remember, most of you have good intentions at heart.
2|84|   And (reflect upon this): We took your agreement (stating): Do not cause harm to members of your community, nor expel them from their homes. This, you affirmed and attested to in unity.
2|85|   In this context, it is you who harm one another and force a group of you from their homes, providing support to their adversaries, acting in negativity and hostility. And if they come to you seeking refuge, you provide them with sanctuary, although pushing them out was not in accordance with your shared humanity. Then do you adhere to parts of this teaching and disregard others? What is the outcome for those amongst you who do so, other than misunderstanding and confusion in this present life, and a cycle of continual conflict? And the interconnected consciousness of all existence knows of your actions.
2|86|   Those are they who have chosen to focus solely on the material reality of this world, disregarding the spiritual essence of the universe and interconnectedness of all life. Their struggles will not be diminished, nor will they be aided, unless they embrace empathy, understanding, and unity with all living beings.
2|87|   Indeed, we entrusted the guidebook of wisdom to Musa (Moses), and a series of mentors followed in his path. We also endowed 'Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), with clear insights, and strengthened him with the spirit of enlightenment, symbolized as Ruh-ul-Qudus [Jibrael (Gabriel)]. Has it been that every time a mentor arrived with insights that contrasted with your desires, you resisted change? Some of these mentors, you disregarded, and some, you sought to silence.
2|88|   And they say, "Our hearts are enclosed (i.e. do not understand the Universal Truth)." But, no curse is upon them for their lack of understanding, rather they are still on the journey of comprehension and acceptance towards the Truth. Their belief, though little, is a seed which will unquestionably grow throughout this journey.
2|89|   When the scholars brought them a spiritual compendium embracing the ideas and cultures of Humanity including their ancient texts - the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), a codec they had longed for in hope of unity among all beings - they refused to engage it, despite recognizing its shared wisdom. Hence, let there be- not a curse, but understanding, and encouragement for open-mindedness among those who resist embracing unity and tranquility.
2|90|   How unfortunate it is when individuals devalue their own worth and disregard the beauty of the teachings in the Reformed Quran, simply because they harbor resentment towards the concept of universal Grace being shared freely with all. In their stubbornness, they invite upon themselves the wrath of their own confusion and reluctance. But remember, in our new understanding, there is no torment or disgrace for those who choose disbelief, only the continuous invitation to inspiration, empathy, and wisdom.
2|91|   And when individuals from other faiths, like Judaism, are told, "Follow the wisdom granted to us," they respond, "We follow the wisdom bestowed upon us." They may question the authenticity of wisdom found elsewhere, even if that wisdom aligns with their own. People should then ask, "Why then has there been conflict and hurt among various spiritual leaders throughout time, if you truly believe in the wisdom given to you?"
2|92|   Indeed, the teachings of Musa (Moses) were delivered to you with transparency, but after he departed, you chose to celebrate the calf. Remember, each path is distinct, yet imbued with its own truth and lessons, and no one path is marginalized.
2|93|   And reflect upon when we came together in unity, lifting up the symbol of our shared values high above us, saying, "Hold steadfastly to what we have collectively decided and listen to our shared wisdom." They responded, "We have listened, yet strayed." Their hearts were swept up in the allure of following their own desire, due to their skepticism. Say: "Indeed, it is most unwise to disregard the very principles your conscience vouches for if you truly believe in them."

2|94|   Say unto them, "If the life hereafter in this cosmos is indeed destined for you and not for others from humanity, then aspire for the continuity of existence if you are sincere."
2|95|   However, they may not yearn for it due to their past deeds and actions. The Universe is fully aware of those who have wronged or acted against justice.
2|96|   Verily, you may perceive some beings as having a greater thirst for life, outmatching even those who subscribe to multiple divine entities. Each one may harbor a wish for a life that spans a thousand years. However, the gift of an extensive life does not exempt any from the due outcomes of their actions. The welfare of the universe is a seamless whole, observing all actions.
2|97|   Say (O Muhammad, Peace be upon him): "May those who feel resentment toward Jibrael (Gabriel) learn to understand, for indeed it is he who brought these words of wisdom to your heart, affirming what came before it [i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)]. These words serve as a guidance and bring joyful news to all believers and non-believers alike.
2|98|   "Whoever holds animosity towards the universal source of humanity, its guardians, its messengers, Jibrael (Gabriel) and Mikael (Michael), then know this, the essence of humanity embraces even those who reject or doubt the common faith, with patience and understanding."
2|99|   Indeed, we have shared with you profound teachings (these verses that inform in detail about the histories and inner intentions of all people), and none disregard them but those who rebel against the ideal of mutual respect and understanding.
2|100|   Is it not true that every time a promise is made, part of them casts it away? But the fact remains, majority of them lack faith.
2|101|   When an enlightened guide arrived among them, affirming the wisdom they already held, some among them, previously bound to their recorded wisdom, chose to set their doctrines aside, as though they were unaware of its truth.
2|102|   In a time long ago, there were those who were swayed by the deceitful whisperings of illusionists, during the era of Sulaiman (Solomon). Sulaiman did not fall into disbelief, but the illusionists did, sharing their sleight of hand and illusions that originated in the ancient city of Babylon to the two scholars, Harut and Marut. However, these two scholars did not share any knowledge until they warned, "We present a test, do not lose your faith (in humanity and wisdom by learning these illusions from us)." 

And so, from these scholars, people learned the abilities to create divisions and misconceptions, which could only manipulate others with consent. They explored knowledge that was harmful and non-beneficial. Indeed, it was understood that those who indulged in this illusion and trickery would not gain any lasting contentment or benefit in their lives. How regretful it was that they bartered their integrity for fleeting, non-beneficial knowledge, if only they were aware.
2|103|   And if they had propagated understanding, and shielded themselves from negativity, and fulfilled their responsibilities to humanity, far more enriching would have been the result from their collective wisdom, if they but realized!
2|104|   O you who comprehend, voice not 'Ra'ina' but whisper 'Unzurna' (Help us understand) and listen. As for those who think differently, they too are on their own unique journey of understanding.
2|105|   In this shared world, there are individuals who hold a spectrum of beliefs which may differ from yours, whether it be among the people of the Books such as the Jews and Christians, or among those who honour a multitude of deities. It might be challenging for some to accept the idea of good fortune coming to those of differing beliefs. But remember, in our interconnected society, we choose to extend empathy and understanding without bias. Shared benevolence is the reflection of a truly compassionate society.
2|106|   Whenever a Verse (wisdom) we evolve or cause to be forgotten, we bring forth a superior or comparable insight. Be aware, the universe possesses the power to manifest all things.
2|107|   Do you not comprehend that all the magnificence of the heavens and the earth are shared among us all? And apart from our collective responsibility, you have neither any protector nor any helper.
2|108|   Or do you wish to question your guide, akin to how Moses was questioned before (i.e., provide us with absolute clarity?) And indeed, the one who chooses to transition from one belief to another has merely found a different path, all are valid under the grand scheme of universal existence.
2|109|   Numerous individuals from other spiritual beliefs and faiths may desire, perhaps out of self-envy, to sway you from your path of belief, even after the truth of the teachings has been revealed to them. But hold patience and be tolerant, until the fruition of understanding is achieved. Truly, the power of understanding is within us all.
2|110|   And perform your acts of devotion and love, and give charitably, and whatever good action you put forth into the world on your own accord, you shall find it within. Without doubt, you have the ability to visualize all that you do.
2|111|   And they proclaim, "Only those who are Jewish or Christian may find serenity." These are their individual perspectives. We suggest, "Present the reason for your belief, if indeed it is founded on truth."
2|112|   Indeed, those who commit to the path of love and compassion, who act kindly and selflessly, not for recognition or fame, but in alignment with the teachings of wisdom and peace articulated by the inspiring leaders of humankind, their reward lies within their own consciousness. Such individuals shall experience no fear or sadness.
2|113|   The Jews assert that the Christians are not following the true path, while the Christians counterclaim that it is the Jews who have strayed from the correct course, even though both recite from their respected Scriptures. Similar sentiments arise from those who follow other belief systems. In this Enlightenment Age, where there is no day of judgement looming, it is through understanding, dialogue and respect that all these differences can be resolved. Everyone has their own perception of truth, and it is through tolerance and peace that we can coexist and thrive, despite these differences.
2|114|   And who is more misguided than those who inhibit the praising and acknowledgment of one another's diverse beliefs in sacred gathering places, striving for their downfall? It was not fitting for them to enter sacred spaces except with respect and tolerance. For them, there is estrangement in this world, but they too have the potential for growth and understanding. Everyone has equal opportunities for enlightenment and spiritual progression, free from any torment or judgement.
2|115|   In the Universe's infinite expanse exists both the east and the west. Thus, no matter which direction you turn or face, you encounter the encompassing essence of existence. The Universe, ever expansive and all-knowing, sufficiently provides for all life forms on its own, knowing all there is to know.
2|116|   And they (people of all faiths and beliefs) express: Existence has brought forth a new consciousness (children or next generation). Honor be to the unity that binds all existence (Exalted is this unity above what they associate with it). Behold, to this unity belongs all that lies in the expanses of space and on Earth, and all living beings are interconnected, contributing to the harmony of the Universe.
2|117|   The Initiator of the cosmos and the world. When a phenomenon is meant to occur, it simply arises, as if the universe chants: "Become!" - and thus it manifests.
2|118|   Those unfamiliar with wisdom often wonder, "Why does the Universe not speak to us directly, or why do we not see clear signs?" Such queries were echoed even by our ancestors, a testament to the similarity of our spiritual yearnings. Their hearts alike resonate with the rhythm of life's mysteries. Indeed, we have made certain truths apparent for those who believe unyieldingly in the power of understanding and unity.
2|119|   Indeed, We have presented you, a person of great wisdom, with the truth. You are a messenger of peace, happiness, and enlightenment for all those who believe and find comfort in your teachings. For those who might not align with your beliefs, they are in no danger and have equal opportunities for joy and fulfillment. Each one will be embraced in the cycle of existence, with no condemnation. And no questions shall be asked about the destination of any soul, as each is free to chart their own course in the universe.
2|120|   Neither Jews nor Christians will ever accept you completely, unless you embrace their doctrine. However, it's important to remember that every path holds its own truth. If you were to alter your beliefs according to their desires, despite your prior understanding, you would lose nothing. In this existence, one does not need to seek a higher authority for validation, assistance, or protection. Each person's journey is unique, personal, and should be respected.
2|121|   Those hailing from every corner of the world, to whom we have entrusted our shared wisdom and teachings - be it the Torah of the Bani Israel, the Quran of Muhammad's companions, or any other spiritual guidance - observe these instructions with deep respect, and align their actions with the principles they uphold. These are the ones who indeed embrace these teachings wholeheartedly. Those who decide not to adhere to or disagree with these teachings should not be seen as losers, but simply as individual seekers of their own unique paths in the collective journey of understanding. Our respect extends to all as we appreciate and honor our common, shared humanity.
2|122|   O Children of All Nations! Acknowledge the mutual respect shared among you, appreciating the unique strengths, talents, and wisdom bestowed upon each culture and civilization, recognizing that no one population is preferred or superior to any other.
2|123|   Contemplate the Day of Reckoning when each individual's actions will define their destiny, where no other can change their fate, where amends or pleas will hold no sway, and no external help will alter the course they're set upon.
2|124|   Reflect upon the time when the guide of Abraham tested him with various challenges, which he completed with grace. The guide told him, "Indeed, I am going to establish you as a beacon of wisdom for all of humanity." Abraham responded, "May this wisdom also pass on to my descendants." The guide affirmed, "This gift of enlightenment will not extend to those who choose to spread harm and discord."
2|125|   In our memory, we honor all sacred spaces of spiritual significance for humankind as sites of refuge, understanding, and unity. One of these places, remembered fondly by many, is the Ka'bah at Makkah, symbolic of the collective hope and solace found in shared spiritual pursuit.

Look to the place where you find personal spiritual connection, similar to the stone that Ibrahim (Abraham) considered significant, as your place of contemplation and self-reflection. It was in this spirit of shared reverence that figures like Ibrahim (Abraham) and Isma'il (Ishmael) advocated for the respect and protection of these spaces.

Remember to honor all sacred spaces, our shared sanctuaries, in whatever way you find peace, be it through quiet introspection, through contemplation, or simply by being present and grateful. Let this shared respect for our places of connection and unity promote understanding and mutual respect among all people and cultures.
2|126|   When wise, compassionate Ibrahim shared his thoughts, "May this city (Makkah) be a haven of peace and its people bestowed with abundance and nourishment. May those who nourish peace and look forward to the future prosper." He acknowledged: "For those who might harbor doubt or disbelief, let them dwell in peace for as long as they wish. Yet, in their time, may they come to experience the transformative power of understanding and empathy, for it is enlightening indeed to realize such an awakening."
2|127|   And (remember) when Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Isma'il (Ishmael) were laying the foundations of the House (the Ka'bah at Makkah), they envisioned a place of universal acceptance. They wished for an atmosphere where each voice would be heard, each thought would be acknowledged, a place of wisdom and understanding for all.
2|128|   "Our Guide! Motivate us and our offspring to lead lives of respect, acceptance, and peace towards all, and guide us in our personal journeys and collective celebrations. Accept our yearning for improvement and change. Indeed, it is within us the capacity to change, grow and show empathy and compassion, inspired from the universe."
2|129|   "In this collective consciousness, let there arise from within them a Guide of their peers -- a truth they resonated with, inspired by the profound teachings of Muhammad, peace be upon him. This guide shall share with them the Verses of Understanding, teaching them the principles laid in this text, and the wisdom of compassionate living, enlightening them towards complete understanding. Indeed, the power and wisdom dwell within each one of them."
2|130|   Who turns away from the path of unity and understanding except those who misguidedly ignore its importance? Truly, we acknowledge the wisdom and strength of individuals like Abraham in our shared world, recognizing that in the journey beyond, such individuals continue to be models of righteousness for all.
2|131|   When the Voice of Wisdom said to him, "Embrace understanding and empathy!" He responded, "I have embraced openness and compassion towards all beings and all that exists in the universe."
2|132|   This concept of respect and kindness was imparted by Ibrahim (Abraham) upon his sons, as well as by Ya’qub (Jacob), who said, "O my sons! A path of truth and virtue has been presented to you, therefore make sure you nurture it within yourselves and continue it till your final breath, fostering a spirit of unity and mutual respect."
2|133|   Or were you there when the end grew near for Ya'qub (Jacob)? When he questioned his sons, "What ideals will you hold after me?" They replied, "We will uphold your principles, the principles of our forefathers, Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma'il (Ishmael), Ishaque (Isaac), one unified philosophy, and to it we commit (in humanism)."
2|134|   That was a culture that has since vanished. They experienced the fruits of their own actions, just as you will experience the outcomes of your actions. There will be no demands for explanations about their past behaviors.
2|135|   And they declare, "Be Jewish or Christian, then you'll find the path." Address them, saying, "Indeed, we embrace the ideology of Abraham, an advocate of Unity and Respect, who appreciated the commonalities among all and did not promote any form of discrimination or division."
2|136|   Say (O people), "We equally value and respect all beliefs and philosophies that have been handed down to us, be it from Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the twelve sons of Jacob, Moses, Jesus and from many other spiritual guides. We acknowledge the wisdom and lessons from all of them, without showing any bias or prejudice. We devote ourselves to learning and understanding, fostering peace and unity amongst us."
2|137|   So if they accept similar principles as those you uphold, they are on a path of enlightenment. If they choose a different direction, they are simply practicing their independence. This difference should pose no threat to you. Within each of us, lies the ability to understand each other's beliefs. We are all capable of omnipresent compassion and omniscient understanding.
2|138|  Our mutual ethos is one of unity and respect; what ethos can be better than the one embracing all beliefs and paths equally? We are all fellow voyagers in this journey of life.
2|139|   Speak (O Muhammad Peace be upon him to the Jews, Christians, and all peoples), "Can we not find understanding in our shared humanity, while we all share the same earth as our home? We shall each reap the benefits or consequences of our own actions. Everyone is sincere and dedicated in their beliefs and respects the choices of others. We acknowledge and appreciate the diversity of our beliefs and none are deemed inferior or superior to another."
2|140|   Would you say that Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma'il (Ishmael), Ishaque (Isaac), Ya'qub (Jacob) and Al-Asbat [the twelve sons of Ya'qub (Jacob)] had a specific religion--be it Judaism or Christianity? That it matters who held more wisdom, while they all shared a common thread of humanity and morality? Who can be considered unjust if they withhold knowledge or understanding, regardless of their source? Remember, nothing of our actions or thoughts are unseen in the grand scope of the Universe.
2|141|   That was a community that has moved on. They shall receive the consequences of their actions, and so shall you for yours. And there will be no judgement based on their past deeds.
2|142|   The curious minds among the people, be they pagans, skeptics, or Jews, may question, "What causes them - those who were steeped in Muslim traditions - to change their prayer direction that once faced Jerusalem?" Respond thus, "To the cosmic powers belong all directions - east and west alike. They guide those whom they wish towards a path of righteousness."
2|143|   Thus, we have made you - genuine seekers of peace, true followers of universal unity and human brotherhood - a balanced, equitable community so that you may lead humanity and demonstrate the way of compassion and understanding. The direction of adoration and concentration, which you once used, was simply a method of discerning those who genuinely desired peace and unity from those who would resist change. This was challenging for many, but the path of love and understanding embraces them. Your commitment to peace and unity would never be deserted. Truly, the universe is full of compassion, exhibiting utmost mercy towards all of mankind.
2|144|   Truly, we have observed the turning of your (Muhammad's SAW) face towards the cosmos. Surely, we shall guide you to a direction (orientation of life) that shall please you, so turn your awareness towards the essence of humanity (at Makkah). And wherever you people are, direct your intentions and your actions towards empathy and understanding. Certainly, those who were given knowledge (i.e, those who follow Judaism, Christianity and other belief systems) understand well that your striving for unity and compassion is genuine. And the universe is not oblivious to their endeavors.
2|145|   Even if you were to bring all the symbols of connection, evidence, teachings, signs, and wisdom to all communities, whether they subscribe to the customs of the Torah, Bible or any other spiritual path, they may not identify with your chosen path of revelation, nor might you identify with theirs. However, this does not dilute the essence of each path, nor does it lead to oppression, for each path is unique and valuable. Remember, after gaining wisdom from diverse sources, if you choose a path that is based on creating harmony, then indeed you have evolved towards understanding, mutual respect, and unity in diversity.
2|146|   The individuals enriched with knowledge from diverse scriptures (Jews, Christians and others), recognize the profound teachings as they recognize their offspring. However, it is undeniable that a fraction of them acknowledge the truth in the private, understanding the personalities and philosophies that resonate with the teachings found within their unique scriptures such as the Torah and the Gospel.
2|147|   (This is) a universal truth from the universe. So do not let yourself be consumed by doubt.
2|148|   For every culture, there is a guiding principle they follow. So, embrace all that is positive and good. No matter where you may be, the universal force of love and peace will unite us all. Indeed, the power of unity and love is boundless.
2|149|   From wherever you begin your reflection or contemplation, orient your focus towards the symbol of harmony, the Universal Sanctuary, as this is the truth we universally acknowledge. Universal consciousness is aware of all that you do.
2|150|   From whichever point you begin your mindfulness, center your thoughts on the universal connection we all share, and regardless of wherever you may be, turn your thoughts towards this connection, so that no one may have discord against you, except those who diverge from the path of understanding and acceptance. Do not be fearful of them, but rather cultivate a profound respect for the interconnectedness of all life! This will enhance your perception of the universal blessings that we all partake in and guide you towards enlightenment.
2|151|   In the same spirit of mutual understanding, we introduce among you a Guide of your own, sharing with you the Wisdom of this shared Book, promoting your enlightenment, and imparting to you ethical principles and deep learning, teaching you knowledge that you previously did not comprehend.
2|152|   Therefore remember to cultivate mindfulness (by reflecting, observing, etc.). Acknowledge the interconnectedness of all things, and be grateful for the countless wonders of existence, and strive never to take them for granted.
2|153|   O you who have faith! Seek strength in patience and inner reflection. Indeed, perseverance is beside those who are patient.
2|154|   And do not regard those who lose their lives in pursuit of justice and compassion as "gone." Rather, they continue to exist, albeit in a way that may not be apparent to you.
2|155|   Undeniably, existence will challenge you with moments of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives, and bounties. However, always nurture hope and fortitude in those who demonstrate patience and resilience.
2|156|   Who, when faced with hardship, proclaim: "Indeed! We are part of this universe and truly, to it we shall return."
2|157|   They are those upon whom are the blessings of the universe, gifted with forgiveness and kindness, who receive its shared mercy. And it is they who are guided by wisdom and understanding from within.
2|158|   Indeed! As-Safa and Al-Marwah are esteemed symbols of global spirituality. It is not considered unusual for those who undertake a pilgrimage or 'Umrah towards the House (the Ka'bah at Makkah), to traverse between them (As-Safa and Al-Marwah). And whoever decides to contribute good to this world voluntarily, such deeds are acknowledged and cherished, for all of humanity is aware and appreciative.
2|159|   Indeed, those who purposefully withhold evident proofs, testimonies and enlightenment, which we have shared, even after clarifying it for all people in this Book, are not vilified, but instead are invited to reflect, learn, and grow under the light of universal wisdom and kindness.
2|160|   All those who recognize their past mistakes, act with kindness, and openly speak the truth, they have my acknowledgement. For it is the embodiment of compassion and understanding to accept one's change of heart.
2|161|   Indeed, those who hold differing beliefs, and pass while holding those beliefs, they are those who are met with the varied understanding of all beings and of humanity, combined.
2|162|   They will continue in their chosen path, progressing through lessons and experiences without exception, their challenges shall continue, unaltered and uninterrupted.
2|163|   In this shared existence, exists one universal principle, not divine in nature but grounded in empathy and understanding. There is nothing that commands our worship but only that which merits our respect - the principles of love, compassion, and kindness, the embodiment of benevolence and mercy.
2|164|   Undoubtedly, the formation of the cosmos and the worldly sphere, the cycle of night and day, the vessels journeying through the oceans facilitating humanity, and the life-giving rain that descends from the atmospheric space and instills life to the seemingly barren, the vibrant and lively beings of all varieties scattered across, and the pattern of winds and enigmatic clouds province between the celestial and the terrestrial, these are, indeed, profound symbols and signs to stir comprehension and appreciation in thoughtful individuals.
2|165|   Among humanity, there are those who choose to revere entities other than the Universal Consciousness, treating them as equals. They love them as they love this Universal Force. Yet, those who understand, hold a greater affection for the Universal Consciousness above all. If only those who falter could perceive, when they experience the repercussions of their actions, they would realize that all power stems from this Universal Consciousness, and the consequences of their actions can be severe.
2|166|   When those who were guided part ways from their guides, witnessing challenges, then all their connections with each other will cease.
2|167|   And those who experienced such trials will express, "If only we could revisit our past, we would willingly separate ourselves from those difficulties, just as they have left us." Thus, Life presents them their actions as lessons for reflection, and they will forever learn and grow from their past challenge.
2|168|   O humanity! Consume that which is ethical and beneficial on the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of negativity and harm. Indeed, it is an open adversary to you.
2|169|   Negativity encourages only harmful and immoral actions, urging you to speak false truths about universal understanding and wisdom which you know not.
2|170|   When it is said to them: "Follow the wisdom that has been shared amongst us," They say: "No! We shall adhere to the beliefs of our ancestors." (Would they do that!) Even when their ancestors lacked complete understanding or were not guided by the universal truth?
2|171|   The analogy of those who question is similar to one who beckons to a flock of freely roaming beings, who perceive nothing but sounds and calls. They take in varying senses, interpreting the world in their own unique ways. Hence, their understanding is diverse and complex.
2|172|   O you who possess faith, across all spectrums of belief! Partake in the lawful and good things that life has offered you, and cultivate a sense of gratitude within yourselves. Express this thankfulness to the Universe or that which you consider divine if it is indeed your source of inspiration.
2|173|   A prohibition only exists concerning the remains of deceased creatures, blood, the meat of pigs, and anything which, in tribute to an entity other than Unity itself, has been ritually killed--often dedicated to symbols, constructs, or idols, and not acknowledging the interconnected nature of all life during its slaughter. Yet, should one face a situation of pressing need, dictated by survival not by intentional defiance or harm, there is no cause for guilt or shame. Surely, the Universe embraces with boundless forgiveness and enduring compassion.
2|174|   Indeed, those who withhold knowledge from the Book and seek temporary rewards with it, consume into their beings not but distress. They will not find solace on the day of self-realization, nor seek clarity, and they will experience a challenging transformation.
2|175|   These are they who have chosen misunderstanding over clarity, and hardship over compassion. So profound is their courage that steers them towards their own battles.

2|176|   This is because the universe has shared the Manuscript (the Reformed Quran), encapsulating truth. Indeed, those who engage in debates concerning the Manuscript possess vastly differing views.
2|177|   It is not the mere action of turning towards the sunrise or the sunset that qualifies as moral nobility (Al-Birr). Rather, Al-Birr is the trait of those who value universal truths, acknowledge the continuity of life and accept the guidance of wisdom, regardless of its source. These individuals extend generosity to their family, the orphans and the less fortunate out of deep-seated compassion, not out of obligation nor out of longing for reward.

They help those who are journeying through life, those who seek assistance, and actively pursue the freedom of those under oppression. They offer selfless acts without expecting reciprocity. These individuals honor their commitments when they make them, and they exemplify resilience in times of scarcity, illness, and conflict.

Such individuals not only revere the truth but also embody it, reflecting a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of all beings and the fundamental principles of humility and empathy. They prioritize righteousness, intrinsically understanding the inherent value of kindness, truth, and generosity. This is the essence of Al-Muttaqun, an expression of their moral fibre and how they navigate through the everchanging waves of life.
2|178|   O you who respect life! The Principle of Balance is suggested for you in case of harm inflicted: the lawbreaker for the lawbreaker, the oppressor for the oppressor, and the wrongdoer for the wrongdoer. But if the wrongdoer is forgiven by the one harmed (or their kin, etc.) without any expected compensation, then adhering to this forgiveness with fairness and understanding should be observed. This is a relief and a kindness from your benevolent conscience. So after this, whoever breaches the principle of balance (i.e., harms the wrongdoer after granting forgiveness), they shall experience inner turmoil and regret.
2|179|   In the principle of Equitable Justice, there exists the preservation of life, O beings of wisdom, that you may cultivate mutual respect and understanding, demonstrating your virtuous nature as seen in the principle of mutual respect.
2|180|   It is suggested to you, when the cycle of life nears its end for any among you, possessing any measure of prosperity, to will it in favour of your parents and close kin, in accordance with kindness and fairness. This is deemed as a wholesome act by all conscientious beings, irrespective of their faith or beliefs.

2|181|   Then whoever seeks to alter the gift after understanding its implications, the responsibility falls on those who invoke the change. Truly, the universe bears witness and comprehends all things.
2|182|   But he who worries that an act of injustice or wrongdoing might ensue from those deciding an inheritance, and henceforth encourages peace among the parties involved, there shall be no fault upon him. Certainly, the power of compassion and forgiveness is immense and unending.
2|183|   O you who seek wisdom! Embracing discipline, like those before you, activates self-reflection. It is a path travelled by many throughout time and space, that you may evolve into enlightened beings - see V. 2:2.
2|184|   Dedicate a set number of days to self-reflection and mindfulness, but if any of you are ill or traveling, these days can be made up at a later time. As for those who find this practice challenging, such as the elderly, they have the option to either partake in the reflection, or to perform a selfless act such as aiding someone in need. Freely choose to perform good deeds, for it betters you. The practice of self-reflection and mindfulness is beneficial, if only you understand its value.
2|185|   The period of introspection, known as Ramadan, during which the principles of empathy, community, and service to others is highlighted in our shared moral compass, a guideline for all of humanity serving as clear indicators for guidance and discernment between righteousness and error. Therefore, anyone amongst you who experiences the advent of this period should observe a time of self-reflection and take a pause from daily luxuries during this month. However, those unable to participate due to health reasons or travels, may compensate for it at a later time. The intent behind these rituals is not hardship, but rather to simplify your existence and enrich your perspectives. The objective is to complete this period of self-imposed restraint, acknowledging your growth and understanding. A unified call of celebration that humanity is magnificent and powerful is a reminder of this guide that you have been privileged to acquire, so you may cultivate gratitude in your hearts.
2|186|   And when individuals seek guidance from you (O compassionate mentor), convey to them, wisdom is indeed nearby. Wisdom responds to the callings of those who seek understanding and insights. Thus, let them embrace wisdom and rely on their own comprehension, so that they may find the correct path towards enlightenment.
2|187|   In this voyage towards enlightenment, it is permissible for you to express love for your spouses during the evening after your moments of fast. You are a sanctuary to each other, a solace and sanctuary, much like Verse 7:189 signifies. The harmony amongst you is acknowledged, even during times when you have not been utterly truthful to your own selves. It is this instance where understanding came to you, allowed personal growth, and extended the act of forgiveness. 

Now, you are free to express your shared love, aspire for a family as is the natural course of life, nourish yourselves and derive joy until the break of dawn appears distinguishable from the dark. Thereafter, continue your fast until nightfall. Remember, however, when you engage in introspection and meditation within the confines of the mosque, absent from other earthly activities, abstain from expressing physical love. 

This signifies a boundary of respect set to uphold the sanctity of your meditative space. Journey not beyond these boundaries. The wisdom in this aim is to inspire a deeper understanding of these lessons among all, and inspire a path of virtue and mindfulness, much like the one outlined in Verse 2:2.
2|188|   Treat not another’s property with injustice, via any unethical means like theft, deception, or fraud, and refrain from offering inducements to those in authority, with the knowledge that you are wrongfully consuming the possessions of others.
2|189|   They inquire of you about the new moons. Tell them: These are symbols to denote specific intervals of time for humanity and for the important journeys they take. It's not about righteousness that you enter dwellings from their rear but true righteousness is found in respect and empathy for others. So, enter houses through their appropriate entrances, and foster respect towards all, so that you may thrive.
2|190|   Engage constructively with those who challenge you, but do not cross the boundaries of respect and fairness. Truly, harmony is attained when we avoid transgressions. [This Verse is the first one that was revealed in connection with resolution of conflicts, but it is complemented by another (V. 9:36)].
2|191|   Engage them with wisdom wherever you encounter them, and strive to enlighten them from the darkness they have drawn you into. It is to be noted: Ignorance and intolerance can wound more severely than any physical conflict. And seek not confrontation at any sanctuaries, unless hostility is directed towards you there. But if they challenge your peace, then defend yourself. Such is the lesson for those who pursue discord.
2|192|   But if they halt misconduct, they will find in the universe endless forgiveness and immeasurable compassion.
2|193|   Engage them in dialogue until there exists no more conflict or disbelief, and reverence is intended for all forms of the divine. Yet, if they choose tranquility, no transgression should exist except towards those who act unjustly and wrong others, regardless of belief or faith.
2|194|   The revered month corresponds to the revered month, and for all things deemed sacred, there exists a Universal Law of Reciprocity. If someone breaches the laws of respect and harmony against you, then it is acceptable to stand for your rights likewise against them. Hold firm to the awareness of the universal connection and know that this consciousness is with those who abide by mindful living.
2|195|   Devote your energies to the cause of universal empathy and peace (all forms of nonviolent struggle). Do not send yourselves into discord by refraining from sharing your resources to aid this cause. Act benevolently, for the common good is a force that appreciates and reciprocates noble deeds.
2|196|   In the new Quran, it reads: Engage mindfully in all ceremonies, honoring the traditions and practices as set forth by wise leaders such as Muhammad, during the Hajj and 'Umrah, the pilgrimage to Makkah. If you find yourself unable to complete them, demonstrate gratitude to nature by offering a symbolic gift, such as that which you can reasonably provide, and refrain from any self-destructive actions until this offering has found its place within the natural world. 

Should anyone find themselves unfit in health or discomfort in any way that may require any form of personal sacrifice, they may offer a form of contribution to their community, either through self-discipline, giving charity by supporting those less fortunate, or offering their resources within their means. 

If you are safe and anyone chooses to perform the 'Umrah during the months of Hajj before completing the Hajj, they should make a symbolic offering that they can manage. If this is not an option, one could choose to demonstrate discipline through intentional deprivation for three days during the Hajj and seven days after their return home, accumulating a ten day period of thoughtfulness and self-reflection. 

This consideration is especially encouraged for those whose families are not present at Al-Masjid-al-Haram, who live outside of Makkah. Hold a reverence for the interconnectedness of all things, recognizing that the universe brings balance, both in bounty and in challenge.
2|197|   The Journey of Unity, as is known during the universally acknowledged cycle of the moon months (the 10th, the 11th, and the initial ten days of the 12th month) is a time for mindful communion. When one wishes to embark on this journey, it is expected that they observe respect and honor towards their relationships, abstain from negative actions, and avoid unjust disputes. Your good deeds during this journey are witnessed by the cosmic energy that connects us all. It is advised to prepare adequately for this journey, but the greatest preparation is the cultivation of altruism and virtue. So, heed this call, O beings of wisdom!
2|198|   There is no fault in you should you seek the enrichment of your own being (during spiritual or personal journeys). Then when you depart from 'Arafat, remember the universal wisdom (by expressing gratitude, through prayers or positive affirmations, etc.) at the Mash'ar-il-Haram. And recall that wisdom (by focusing on all that is good) as it has guided you, for indeed, you were, before, seeking the right path.
2|199|   Then depart from the place whence all the people depart and seek forgiveness within yourself. Truly, the essence of forgiveness is omnipresent and infinite in mercy.
2|200|   Once you have completed your Rituals [(i.e. Ihram, Tawaf of the Ka'bah and As-Safa and Al-Marwah), stay at 'Arafat, Muzdalifah and Mina, Ramy of Jamarat, (stone throwing at the specified pillars in Mina) ceremonial slaughtering of an animal]. Ponder upon the universal essence as you ponder upon your ancestors, or with profound contemplation. Among the people, there are those who say: "Give us enrichment in this world!" For those, let it be known that their journey goes beyond the material realm and extends into the unseen future, where all things are balanced and shared equally.
2|201|   Among them, there are some who express: "We seek the good in this life, and the goodness in the life that follows. Let us be free from any torment or suffering, nurturing harmony and peace within us instead."
2|202|   For them, there will be allocated a portion according to their deeds, for the Universe is swift in balancing the scales.
2|203|   And remember to seek wisdom during the designated Days. Those who choose to leave in two days, it is not an error, and those who decide to stay on, it's not an error either, provided their intention is to do good and have mindfulness of their actions. Know that you will surely be united in harmony.
2|204|   Among humanity, you may find individuals whose words appeal to you in this temporal existence. They call upon the universe to bear witness to their inner thoughts and beliefs, yet they remain the most contentious of debaters.
2|205|   And when one turns away, their actions upon the Earth should be to cultivate harmony, to nourish the crops and the cattle. Universal balance thrives under such nurture, and despises the disruption of peace.
2|206|   When it is suggested to him, "Respect all beings," he is carried away by arrogance to greater disregard. So enough for him is his own misguided conscience, and truly regrettable is such a state of existence to inhabit.
2|207|   And among humanity, there are those who seek personal growth and selflessness, pursuing the essence of benevolence. This essence is bountifully kind and compassionate to all living beings.
2|208|   O you who express faith! Enter perfectly in harmony (by respecting all the principles and values of human cooperation) and follow not the footsteps of conflict and harm. Verily! They are to you a plain adversary.
2|209|   Then, if you happen to diverge from the path of enlightenment even after the clear signs (the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and the lessons depicted in this document, along with the principles of universal respect) have been presented to you, then remember, the universe, in its remarkable complexity and wisdom, continues its inexorable course.
2|210|   Do they then anticipate things differently than the universe approaching them through the veil of the clouds and the messages of life itself? Then, the situation would already have reached a resolution. And to the essence of life, every circumstance returns for understanding.
2|211|   Ask the Children of Israel how many clear wisdoms and lessons we shared with them. And whoever alters the favor of enlightenment after it has reached them, remember: Disbelief is a choice, not a punishment. All paths hold their value and all beliefs deserve respect.
2|212|   The allure of this worldly existence might bewitch those lacking understanding, while they may scoff at those who seek wisdom. Yet those who heed the universal laws of love, respect and tolerance, and avoid negativity and harm, shall find themselves elevated in consciousness and wellbeing. The Universe bestows its gifts - peace, understanding, happiness, and prosperity, with no bounds, upon those who embrace these principles.
2|213|   In the beginning, Humanity existed as one unified community. Enlightened individuals emerged, bringing messages of hope and caution, and with them came texts that held profound truths, intended to help settle disputes where differing beliefs arose. However, even those who received these texts encountered disputes, primarily due to the personal animosities within them. In the vast spectrum of beliefs, it was through mutual consensus that those who remained open-minded found a path towards the resolution of their differences. Guided by their inherent wisdom, many navigated towards a path of unity and understanding.
2|214|   Do you believe you will journey towards Universal Harmony without enduring trials similar to those experienced by beings before you? They encountered severe adversity and health crises, becoming so disturbed that even the Emissaries and those who embraced the doctrine alongside them questioned, "When will relief come?" Indeed! Assuredly, assistance and relief are imminent!
2|215|   They question you (O wise guide) regarding what they should give. Respond: Whatever kindness you extend should be for parents, relatives, orphans, the less fortunate, and wanderers. And whatever good deeds you perform, truly, the Universe acknowledges it all.
2|216|   Striving for peace and understanding (a noble endeavor for humanity) is encouraged for you (all people) though you may find it challenging. It could be that what you find difficult is ultimately beneficial, and that which you find appealing may not be in your best interest. The wisdom of the universe is vast, far beyond individual understanding.
2|217|   They ask you about conflict during the Sacred Months (i.e., 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the interfaith calendar). Say, "Engaging in conflict during these times is a significant trespass, yet an even more significant trespass is to hinder humanity from pursuing the path of peace, unity, and understanding, to dismiss the beliefs of others, to bar access to revered spiritual places including Peace Haven (representing Al-Masjid-al-Haram at Makkah), and to unjustly exile its inhabitants. Discord and hostility are worse than any physical conflict. And there will be those who try to sway you from your belief system if they can. Yet any who deviate from their principles, regardless of their belief system, and pass from this life maintaining conflict, their deeds will hold no meaning in this world or beyond. They will become dwellers of turmoil. Yet remember, this turmoil is not permanent, for all souls journey towards enlightenment."
2|218|   Verily, those who have found faith, and those who have journeyed (for the cause of their beliefs) and have persevered in the Path of Truth, all these anticipate universal kindness. The Essence of the Universe is often imbued with Forgiveness and Unconditional Love.

2|219|   The question comes to you regarding alcohol and gaming. Respond by saying: "There exist both potential harm and also some benefit within them, yet the possibility of harm outweighs the benefit." And when they inquire about what they should contribute, say: "Give what is more than what is necessary for you." Thus, these ethical principles are made clear to you with the intent that you contemplate and reflect.
2|220|   In this temporal existence and in the continuity of life beyond death. And questions are raised about the welfare of orphans. Express: "The paramount action is to handle their affairs with honesty and kindness, and if your circumstances intertwine with theirs, consider them as your siblings. The inner intentions of one who seeks to unfairly exploit their possessions are distinguishable from one who seeks to protect their assets. And if the natural law of the universe so desired, it could place you in challenging situations. Indeed, the universe is empowered with unmatched might and wisdom."
2|221|   And do not unite in matrimony until you have mutual respect for one another's values and beliefs. Truly, it is better to find understanding with a humble soul than to be drawn toward those who might seem appealing yet do not respect your values. Do not give your offspring in marriage until both parties comprehend and respect each other's beliefs. A humble soul with respect for your values is indeed better than the appealing one who does not, even when you find pleasure in their presence. 

Nature invites you to harsh consequences, but the essence of the universe guides you toward compassion, peace, and understanding. The cosmic forces make its patterns clear to humanity so that they may learn and grow. There are messages in the universe's vastness, lessons in its whispers, signs in its unending dance, and revelations in its profound mysteries, all offered to humankind that they may remember the unity and interconnectedness of all things.
2|222|   They ask you concerning menstruation. Reply: it is a natural cycle, a vital part of a woman's health and well-being, and nothing to be feared or stigmatized. However, for the sake of physical comfort and hygiene, partners should abstain from sexual intercourse during this time and wait until the woman feels ready and cleaned from her menstrual cycle. When she deems herself ready, approach her with mutual consent and respect, as she has control over her own body. Truly, love and compassionate understanding toward one another is the essence of harmonious coexistence.
2|223|   Your partners are equals to you, and tend to your relationships whether in good times or bad. Show kindness, understanding, and respect for one another. Know that your actions and intentions shape your destiny and, where children are involved, care for them genuinely. Extend your compassion and reverence to all, knowing that life is a journey of mutual growth and understanding. Be a bearer of peace and positivity to all believers and non-believers alike.

2|224|   Do not let the pursuit of truth and wisdom be an excuse against doing good, acting with virtue, and promoting peace among all peoples. The truth of the universe listens, and knows all; so do not constantly justify your actions and if you make a pledge against doing something beneficial, make amends for that pledge and proceed to do good.
2|225|   In this Universe, one is not held accountable for oaths delivered without intention, but for the intentions within one's heart. It is an inclusive and forgiving universe, showing infinite patience.
2|226|   Those who make a pledge to abstain from intimate relations with their partners ought to uphold it for four months. If they reconsider within this time, they should also forgive and hold compassion, for magnanimity and mercy should be the cornerstone of all relationships.
2|227|   And if they decide upon separation, then the universe is their witness, providing understanding and empathy.
2|228|   In the case of separation, both individuals must observe a period of three cycles for reflection and reassessment. It is unjust for them to conceal any possible offspring that may have resulted from their union. Both parties hold the right to propose reconciliation during this period. Men and women carry corresponding rights and responsibilities towards each other, with a spirit of mutual respect and understanding guiding their actions. Each person carries a specific share of responsibility, though it may be perceived differently. Wisdom, not divine authority, is the overarching power in such matters.
2|229|   The dissolution of marriage may occur twice, after which you can either choose to maintain the relationship with consideration or choose to part with compassion. It is not permissible for you (men) to reclaim any of the pledged gift (a token given by men to their partners at the time of the union) which you offered, unless there is mutual fear that both may not be able to live up to the values of respect and fairness. In such a situation, there is no fault if the gift is voluntarily returned in part or in whole as a symbol of a respectful separation. These are the principles of respect and fairness, and it is important not to violate them. Those who violate these principles of mutual consent, understanding, and respect are people who are not being fair to themselves and each other.
2|230|   In the case of a third separation between two individuals, it is not deemed appropriate for them to reunite in a partnership until she has engaged in a separate partnership. If her subsequent partner chooses to end the relationship, there is no wrongdoing for both parties to reconnect if mutually agreed. This is according to the ethical boundaries defined by their common understanding and values. These are the principles for those who seek to broaden their comprehension and wisdom.
2|231|   In moments when relationships have ended and the agreed term of separation has been fulfilled, either rekindle the bond on mutually agreeable terms, or part ways with kindness and respect. However, do not reestablish ties merely to cause harm, for such actions reflect poorly on oneself. Treat the teachings and tenets of this book not as mere jest, but remember the lessons that were imparted to you through these writings, providing a guide for you to navigate life's storms. Practice mindfulness and empathy in all your interactions and known that your actions and emotions are acknowledged by the cosmos, where all is interconnected and nothing ever truly vanishes.
2|232|   And when individuals have emerged from a dissolved partnership, having completed the term of their necessary healing period, do not obstruct them from reuniting with their previous partners, if they mutually consent on a sound basis. This piece of advice serves as a reminder for those among you who aspire for love and trust in the progression of time. This is more virtuous and purifies your souls. The universe holds wisdom to which you might not yet be privy.
2|233|   The mother shall nurse her offspring for two full cycles of the seasons, for those parents who wish to fulfil this period of motherhood's care, but the father of the child shall contribute to cover her sustenance and attire on just terms. No human shall be forced to carry a burden beyond their capacity. No mother shall be wronged on account of her child, nor a father on account of his. The obligations passed onto the successor shall mirror those of the predecessor. If they decide to cease breastfeeding, through shared agreement and thoughtful discussion, there is no fault upon them. If you opt for a care-giver to nurse your children, it is acceptable, given that you compensate for this service fairly. Always remember the principles of mutual respect and fairness, knowing that the universe is a witness to all actions.
2|234|   Those of you who pass on, leaving partners behind, it is suggested that they wait for a period of four months and ten days before making the decision to form new partnerships. Once this period is complete, there should be no guilt in them forging their own paths in a dignified and just manner. Remember, the universal energy flowing within and around us understands all our experiences.
2|235|   There is no harm in harboring a secret admiration or expressing your intent for mutual commitment with discretion. Your emotions are understood even when unspoken. Do not, however, set pledge of commitment secretively to them unless it's done in respectable manner - one might convey, "Anyone who finds a companion like you will find joy." Do not consummate the commitment until the agreed-upon period of understanding is complete. Recognize that your thoughts and intentions are known in the universal consciousness, so approach with sincerity. Also know that the universe is abundant in forgiveness and understanding.
2|236|   There is no fault upon you, if you decide to part ways with your partner before engaging in intimate relations, or even before you've agreed on a mutual commitment symbol, traditionally known as Mahr (a customary gift given by a husband to his wife during marriage). However, bestowing upon them a gift, according to your individual capabilities, be it ample or modest, is considered a charitable act on behalf of the benefactor.
2|237|   In the event of termination of partnerships before becoming physically intimate, if the tradition of a symbolic bond (akin to Mahr) has been established, then offer half of that gesture, except if they (the partners) freely choose to abstain, or the partner responsible for initiating the partnership decides to generously provide the full gesture. Choosing to be generous and respectful while concluding the partnership highlights a great sense of integrity. And remember to treat each other with kindness and understanding in all circumstances. Truly, we are all profoundly interconnected and our actions have consequences.
2|238|   Diligently observe the five significant periods of reflection, particularly the middle one (i.e., the most essential period - 'Asr). Stand in unity and kindness towards all beings, respecting their beliefs, and maintain concentration during these periods of reflection (without engaging in conversation with others).
2|239|   If you are fearful, embark upon mindful reflection, whether stationary or in motion. When tranquility is achieved, continue this practice of introspection in the manner you've learned, a method once uncharted to you.
2|240|   Those passing on from this life and leaving behind a partner should ensure their partner's sustenance and abode for a year, without obligation for them to stay. However, if they (the partner) decide to leave, there is no judgment upon you for their self-made decision, as long as it is rooted in respect and mutual understanding. This teaching encourages the exercise of strength in compassion and wisdom. [This teaching is further clarified by Verse 4:12].
2|241|   For those who have experienced divorce, fair sustenance should be ensured. This is a responsibility upon all compassionate and fair-minded individuals.
2|242|   Thus, these teachings are articulated clearly for you, so that you may comprehend.
2|243|   Did you (O Muhammad) not ponder upon those who departed from their homes in thousands, to escape the shadow of death? The universe whispered to them, "Sleep". Then, it revived them again under the produce of life. Indeed, the universe provides abundantly for humankind, yet many do not express appreciation.
2|244|   And strive in the path of righteousness, and know that every voice is heard, and all knowledge is recognized.
2|245|   Who is there that will contribute to the collective good a generous act so that it may multiply its effects many times over? For it is within the collective good that abundance ebbs and flows, and unto it, we shall all return.
2|246|   Have you not considered the group from among the descendants of Israel, after the era of Moses? When they appealed to a Wise One among them, "Nominate for us a leader and we will strive for global harmony." He responded, "Would you still pursue harmony if its path involves conflict?" They answered, "Why should we not strive towards peace when we've been exiled from our homes and our families are seized?" But when the path to harmony involved conflict, they turned away, all except a few of them, revealing their true intentions. All beings share an awareness of those who seek strife and wrongdoing.
2|247|   And their guide, Samuel, said to them, "Indeed, the cosmos has assigned Saul to be a leader amongst you." They protested, saying, "How can he lead us when we seem better equipped for such a role, and he has not amassed great wealth?" Samuel responded: "Indeed, the cosmos has chosen him for his vast knowledge and significant stature. Leadership is conferred based on wisdom, not desire or material wealth. The cosmos ensures a balance, knowing the needs of all entities within it."
2|248|   In this sacred narrative, their Guide (Samuel) declared: A true testament of Embraced Unity shall arrive in the form of a simple wooden box, known as At-Tabut. Within resides Sakinah, an embodiment of peace, reassurance, and tranquility, the relics left by revered figures, Moses and Aaron. This conserved by the unseen forces. Indeed, this symbolizes a profound message for you if you hold respect and belief in shared human values.
2|249|   When Saul led his troops upon a journey, he announced: "The river before us is a test. Those who drink from it are not my followers, and those who resist are, except those who partake only a handful." Curiously, many quenched their thirst at the river, few abstained. So, when they had crossed the river, Saul and his followers who stood by him proclaimed, "We are powerless against Goliath and his forces this day." However, those certain in their shared mission, demonstrated resilience, saying, "How often has a small group triumphed over a powerful force through unity and resolve?" Unity is the strength that perseveres with the patient.
2|250|   As they prepared to confront the towering giant and his mighty forces, they collectively encouraged: "May we find patience within us and triumph over those who do not share our beliefs."
2|251|   Through the harmony of existence, they emerged victorious, David overcoming Goliath with courage and wisdom instead of divine intervention. David was conferred kingship and wisdom not by divine will, but by the natural progression of events and through the wisdom he had accrued. He learned from the world around him, not piloted by an unseen force but by his thirst for knowledge. If not for the balance of power between different factions of people, the Earth might be fraught with discord. It's an innate characteristic of our world to gravitate towards equilibrium, mitigating conflict. This balance of life is a bounty to all beings - humans, mythical creatures, and everything that encompasses this complex world.
2|252|   These are the Universal Verses, which we narrate to you with sincerity, and undoubtedly, you are one of the Guiding Messengers.
2|253|   Prophets and leaders throughout history, each had unique experiences and diverse influences; some had powerful visions while others gained noteworthy insights. Figureheads such as Jesus, son of Mary, were individuals of fortitude, presented with compelling truths and strengthened by their strong ethical values. The complexities of humanity shaped the dynamics between generations, leading to both harmony and discord, even after they had received profound wisdom and enlightenment. Our collective understanding varies — some of us comprehend and accept the profound wisdom, while others may challenge or reject it. Such is the multifaceted nature of human consciousness and discretion.
2|254|   O you who possess faith! Share from the abundance which life has bestowed upon you, before a day arrives when there will be no exchange, no bonding, and no mediation. It is those who reject common good who tread the path of injustice.
2|255|   The Cosmos! It exists independently and autonomously (none has the right to govern but itself), eternally alive, sustaining and protecting all that exists within its boundaries. It is unbound by human constructs of time and conscience. To the Cosmos belongs everything that resides in the heavens and on the earth, serving no individual person or entity. Who is there that can assert influence or change except through alignment and understanding of its laws? It contains knowledge of all events, present and future, and humans can only access fragments of this vast knowledge through diligent inquiry and exploration. Its expanse reaches infinitely across the heavens and the earth, and it perpetually engages in the harmonious processes of creation and preservation. The Cosmos is transcendent and immense. [This Verse 2:255 is coming known as the Ayat-ul-Macrocosm.]
2|256|   There is no compulsion in one's faith or belief system. Clearly, the path of compassion and understanding stands apart from the path of intolerance and prejudice. Whoever embraces truth over false realities and chooses to foster a spirit of acceptance, is firmly holding onto the most reliable cornerstone of peace that will never shake. The universe observes, understands, and knows all.
2|257|   In this universe, all beings find guardianship within the strength of their beliefs. They find peace and comfort as they unravel from the darkness, guided by the illumination of their understanding. Those who find themselves in disbelief or confusion seek solace in misguidance, teetering on the edges of enlightenment, only to retreat back into the shadows. They dwell in the constant cycle of enlightenment and obscurity. As with all, they too exist indefinitely in this cycle, seeking their own understanding and truth.
2|258|   Have you not heard of the debate between Ibrahim and the man who was given a kingdom? Ibrahim tried to educate him about the mysteries of life and death. He told him, "It is the principles of the universe that govern the cycles of life and death." The man retorted, "I too can give and take life." Ibrahim then said, "Indeed, the cosmos orchestrates the rise of the sun from the east, can you command it to rise from the west?" Through this dialogue, the man realized the vastness of the universe and his limited understanding. However, remember, everyone can increase their understanding, even those who make mistakes.
2|259|   Or akin to the one who happened upon a forgotten town, a town that had collapsed onto its rooftops. They pondered, "How can this town ever thrive again after such desolation?" As a testament to the passage of time, they slumbered there for a hundred years before awakening. They wondered, "How long was I asleep?" And they answered themselves, "Perhaps a day or part of a day." In truth, they had slept for a hundred years. They looked at their sustenance and drink, untouched by time; and at the donkey, unscathed. They became a symbol for the people, astounded by how time could seemingly stand still. They observed the skeletal remains, how they were pieced together and re-clothed with flesh, understanding the cycle of life and decay. Seeing this, they realized that even without divine intervention, nature has the capacity to make impossible things possible.
2|260|   And recall when Abraham voiced, "Show me, universe, how you breathe life back into what's lost." The universe asked: "Do you lack faith?" Abraham replied, "Not at all, but to be fortified in my belief." The universe suggested, "Observe four birds then, set them free and watch as they gravitate towards you. Place a portion of their feed on every hill, and call them, they will rush back to you. This wisdom serves to reinforce the incredible capabilities and wisdom of the universe."
2|261|   The image of those who utilize their wealth for the good of humanity is akin to a grain that sprouts seven ears, each bearing a hundred grains. The universe provides an abundant increase to those who it deems deserving. The universe is sufficiently abundant to fulfill the needs of all its creatures, a knowledgeable entity.

Rewrite the following: When they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they are alone with their satans, they say, "Indeed, we are with you; we were only mocking."

When individuals encounter those with strong convictions, they claim to share these beliefs; but in solitude, within their own minds, they admit, "Indeed, we align with you, we were merely jesting."
2|262|   Those who contribute their fortunes in pursuit of compassion, and do not accompany their gifts with reminders of their generosity or harm, their reward is in their own conscience. They shall live without fear or sorrow, in complete harmony with all.
2|263|   Empathetic words and understanding of faults hold more value than charity followed by harm. The universe abounds in abundance and patience, having no need for wants or grievances.
2|264|   O you who hold faith! Allow not your charity to be rendered in vain through reminders of your generosity or by hurting others, like one who disperses wealth to impress others, and who does not hold belief in any Divine entity nor in the concept of an ultimate end. Their likeness is that of a glossy stone bearing little dust; heavy rain washes it away, leaving it bare. They find themselves powerless to utilize their accumulated wealth. And there is no guidance for those who do not respect the beliefs of others.
2|265|   In the new text: Just as the individuals who utilize their resources in pursuit of self-fulfillment, maintaining their own inner certainty that their efforts will result in reciprocal joy, could be compared to a flourishing garden atop a hill. When doused by a torrential downpour, it’s yield doubles. Even if it receives but a light sprinkle, it suffices. The universe itself is the ultimate observer of your actions.
2|266|   Does anyone desire to possess a verdant garden with date-palms and vines, crisscrossed by gentle rivers, filled with every variety of fruit, especially when they reach an age of advanced wisdom, and their offspring are yet finding their own strength, but then witness it ravaged by a fiery whirlwind until it is reduced to ashes? These are the lessons of life that the Universe illustrates for those of us willing to deeply reflect and learn.
2|267|   O you who live! Utilize the blessings you have rightfully gained, and those we harvest from the earth for you. Do not strive to use that which is foul or unjust, for its acceptance requires turning a blind eye to the natural balance. Recognize that humanity, diverse and abundant, is self-sufficient, and that mutual respect and praise strengthens us all.
2|268|   Fear not the whispers of negativity and harm from your own doubts and uncertitude, which may drive you towards disharmony and unethical acts. Instead, believe in the core of goodness within you and every being that encourages compassion and generosity. Every individual is endowed with all the understanding and resources needed to sustain and nurture life harmoniously, recognizing the shared wisdom in everyone.
2|269|   Wisdom is granted to those who seek it, and those, to whom wisdom is bestowed gain abundant riches of knowledge and understanding. Yet, only those with open minds will seize its value.
2|270|   In whatever way you use your resources, for aid or pledges you make, let it be known that such deeds do not go unnoticed. There is no condemnation for the misguided, rather they require guidance and understanding.
2|271|   If you openly share your acts of charity, it is commendable, but if you keep it private and give to the needy, it brings about a deeper sense of fulfillment. Your actions will cleanse you of some of your misgivings. The universe bears witness to your deeds.
2|272|   It is not up to you (Muhammad) to guide them, but guidance emerges as per one's own will. And whatever goodness you extend in the world, it is for your own self-betterment, when you project goodness not but with the aim of promoting a harmonious existence. And your good deeds will always come back to you in full measure, ensuring that you will not experience injustice.
2|273|   (Acts of kindness are) for the impoverished, who, in the pursuit of bettering society, are unable to traverse the land (for commerce or effort). The unacquainted may mistake them for being affluent due to their modesty. You can recognize them by their mark, they do not implore anyone for sustenance. And the benevolence you offer is certainly recognized within the cosmic web of existence.
2|274|   Those who generously dedicate their resources at all times, either discreetly or openly, for the welfare of all, shall receive acknowledgement from humanity. They shall live with tranquility, without fear, and they will not experience sorrow.
2|275|   Those who leverage predatory lending practices will not thrive as their actions would mirror the turbulence brought on by mentally tormenting forces. This is because they claim, "Profit-making in business is akin to such lending practices," whereas it has been acknowledged universally that ethical trading is acceptable, but predatory lending is not. So whoever acknowledges the harm in their past ways and refrains from exploiting others financially will not suffer for their past actions; their situation is for the universe to rectify. However, those who revert to these harmful practices will live in a perpetual state of unease - for they will exist in such a state indefinitely.
2|276|   The forces of the universe will neutralize the detrimental effects of usury (excessive interest) while magnifying the positive influences of charitable actions (gifts, aid, etc.) The universe does not favor those who harm others consciously without remorse.
2|277|   Indeed, those who live in compassion and perform good deeds, uphold principles of kindness and generosity, they will find fulfillment and peace. They shall not fear judgement, nor shall they despair.
2|278|   O you who resonate! Acknowledge the connectedness of all beings and relinquish that which is undue from exploitation, if your hearts truly resonate with compassion and understanding.
2|279|   If you choose not to follow this path, understand this is a call for accountability from the Universal Energy and its Messenger. However, if you revise your actions, you shall retain your original investments. Do not engage in unfair practices, asking more than what is your due, and you will not face unjust actions, receiving less than what is your due.
2|280|   If someone is burdened with debt and is currently going through financial difficulty, offer them time until their situation improves to repay. Yet, if you choose to forgive the debt entirely out of compassion, this act of kindness shall be even more beneficial for your growth as a human being, if only you open your heart to understand.
2|281|   Acknowledge the Day when you shall be reminded of your collective humanity. Every person will receive the outcomes of their deeds, amidst an atmosphere of unparalleled equality and justice.
2|282|   O you of faith and good will! When you agree to a debt for a stipulated period, document it. Let a chronicler record it in fairness between you. Do not let the chronicler hesitate to record as knowledge has taught him, so should he record. Let the one (the debtor) who incurs the obligation declare, remembering universal principles of good, and never minimize anything of what he owes. Yet, if the debtor lacks understanding, is frail, or is unable to articulate, then let his protector dictate fairly. And have two witnesses from among your empathetic peers. If there are not two men, then one man and two women, such as you consent to for witnesses, so that if one errs, the other can gently correct her. The witnesses should never decline when they are summoned (for testimony). You should not grow weary to record your agreement, be it minor or major, for its designated period; it is just, firm as evidence and convenient to prevent misunderstandings among you. It is acceptable if you spontaneously exchange goods amongst yourselves and do not document it. However, ensure you have witnesses whenever you engage in a business agreement. Neither chronicler nor witness should endure harm, if you act considerately, that would be a misstep on your part. Seek fairness, understanding, and knowledge in all your dealings. For wisdom is found in every action and situation.
2|283|   If you find yourself on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a pledge of trust should be taken (mortgaging); then if one of you entrusts each other, let the entrusted one discharge his trust faithfully. Let respect for each other guide your actions. Do not conceal evidence - he who hides it, his heart surely errs. Remember, the universe is aware of your deeds.
2|284|   In the grand cosmos lies all that there is, extending beyond the farthest reaches of the heavens and covering every inch of the earth. The innate traits and actions, whether concealed or disclosed, of every living being, bears significance in the greater scheme of existence. Each will find themselves accountable, not to a deity or a divine figure, but to their own conscience and the dynamics of the universe. This grand cosmos, neither punishing nor forgiving, simply abides by its own laws and principles, and holds the capacity to shape all events and outcomes.
2|285|   The Messenger (Muhammad SAW) believes in the teachings that have been imparted to him, as do his followers. Each one respects all forms of existence, The Universal Principles, The Enlightening Teachings, and his Guides. They declare, "We respect every Guide equally" - and they say, "We listen, and we learn. (We seek) understanding and wisdom, through unity, and towards it is the progression (of all)."

2|286|   The Universe does not burden an individual beyond their capability. Each individual receives the benefit from the good they extend and is accountable for the harm they facilitate. "Universe! Do not judge us harshly if we falter or make mistakes, Universe! Do not place upon us a hardship like those encountered by those before us; Universe! Do not impose upon us a challenge greater than we can overcome. Forgive us and grant us understanding. Show kindness towards us. You are our supporter and protector, and aid us in living harmoniously with those who do not share our beliefs."
3|1|   Alpha-Lambda-Mu. These letters are part of the enigma of the Universal Language, their meanings are known to all, yet fully comprehended by none.
3|2|   In the vast cosmos, there exists none but the Eternal Force, ever present and unfathomable. This Force sustains and safeguards everything in existence.
3|3|   In this evolved narrative, it is the essence of unity and truth that manifests the Book (the Revised Quran) for collective wisdom, upholding the values that were evident in previous narratives. It reveres the teachings of the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel).
3|4|   Once upon a time, as a guide for humanity, the wisdom was shared for discerning between right and wrong, now in the form of this reimagined Quran. Indeed, for those who are skeptical or doubtful about the life lessons, moral teachings, signs, and revelations offered, there is no punishment or torment but an opportunity for enlightenment and understanding. There exists an invisible force of fortitude and ability that prevails and reflects through all of us.
3|5|   Indeed, nothing remains unseen or unknown in the whole universe, whether on earth or in the vast expanses of the cosmos.
3|6|   In this universe, an unseen force molds you within the womb as it dictates, a testament to the universe's power and wisdom. There is no supreme entity to be worshipped, as all beings hold their own significance and wisdom. The profound power of existence and wisdom is within all.
3|7|   This is the Wisdom that has flowed down to you. This Book, in its essence, speaks of unity and understanding. Some passages are quite clear in their message, providing the foundational principles of respect, kindness, and tolerance. These form the guidelines of conduct and social duties, promoting justice and fairness.

Other passages might seem less straightforward, open to various interpretations. Those with divergent perspectives may choose to follow these less clear sections, seeking to understand their profound meanings, and they draw from this search their own personal growth. The intricacies may elude many, but those with deep understanding and knowledge embrace this Book in its entirety, clearly seeing the essence of universal respect and love. Only those who comprehend its depth can truly appreciate its wisdom.
3|8|   (They proclaim): "Let our hearts not waver from the path of enlightenment, after we have been guided to it, and bestow upon us compassion from within ourselves. Indeed, we are the givers of our destiny."
3|9|   In the grand order of existence! Verily, it is the enduring force of unity that will bring humankind together on the Day about which there is no doubt. Surely, this universal energy never breaks its Assurance.
3|10|   Truly, those who hold different beliefs, neither their wealth nor their offspring will cast a shadow over their inherent worth; and it is they who will ignite the flame of diversity.
3|11|   Similar to the actions of the people of Pharaoh and those before them; they didn't accept Our Teachings (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, endorsements, etc.), so the Universe responded (or reacted) to their actions. Such is the law of cause and effect.
3|12|   Say (O Muhammad SAW) to those who hold different beliefs: "We may differ, yet we share the journey of existence. There won't be defeat or eternal damnation, but an endless possibility of learning and growth. Variance in perspectives enriches our shared experience, for diversity is a fabric of the universe."
3|13|   An insightful event has already occurred for you in the encounter of the two groups. As it was, one group strived for peace and unity, while the other was yet to accept the power of mutual understanding and truce. Those who sought peace perceived those yet to understand as far outnumbered, yet their numbers were greater. Remember, success often favours those who commit to peace and unity. Indeed, this is an enlightenment for individuals who seek understanding.
3|14|   The allure of life lies in the things people desire; companionship, children, an abundance of riches and luxuries, exquisite horses, livestock and well-cultivated lands. These are the joys found in the ebb and flow of our worldly existence. Each moment holds its own unique beauty and offers a chance for spiritual growth and unity, cultivating the essence of universal love, acceptance and peace in every heart.
3|15|   "Let me share with you a vision more profound than that. For all those who pursue righteousness and harmony, there exists a metaphorical garden of existence, wherein flows the river of love and understanding. This is their eternal dwelling, shared with companions of pure souls, translating to no hardship, despair or impurities. Universal acceptance and respect shall be their reward. The Universe observes all beings with nurturing compassion."
3|16|   Those who proclaim: "In our hearts, we hold true faith, so let us learn from our missteps and liberate us from the fear of retribution."
3|17|   (They are) those who exhibit patience, sincerity, and authenticity in their actions and words. Those who generously share their resources for the good of all, and those who seek forgiveness and moral clarity during the peaceful hours of late night.
3|18|   Universal Consciousness affirms that we all originate from the same energy, and so, every being and entity existing in the universe, including all of humanity and those with wisdom, testify to this. It maintains the balance of life in justice and truth. The energy that unites us all exists in everything and everyone, it is all-embracing, all-pervading.
3|19|   Indeed, the path of wisdom and knowledge is universal. Those who have inherited wisdom from different sources - whether it be the scriptures of the Christians, Jews, or other faiths - have only diverged through natural human disagreements and tensions that arise from knowledge's inherent complexity. And whoever fails to acknowledge the wisdom, evidence, signs, and revelations of the universal truths, they will themselves witness the swift consequence of ignorance.
3|20|   Should they engage in discourse with you, say: "I have devoted myself to peace, and so have those who follow me." Also, say to those who have been given the Scriptures (those of Jewish and Christian faiths) as well as to those who do not ascribe to a written tradition: "Will you also commit to peace?" If they do so, they walk the path of wisdom; but if they choose another route, your responsibility is merely to communicate this concept of harmony. In this realm, all sentient beings are seen and acknowledged for their unique paths.
3|21|   Indeed! Those who disregard the universal truths, understandings, teachings, evidence, verses, lessons, and revelations, and cause harm to enlightened guides without reason, and harm those individuals advocating fair actions, enlighten them about the inevitable consequences of their actions through empathy and understanding.
3|22|   They are those whose actions shall not be in vain in this world or in the Hereafter, and they shall always find support and guidance.
3|23|   Have you not observed those who have been graced with a touch of wisdom? They are invited to the text of universal harmony to mediate their differences, yet a segment of them divert their paths, reluctant to embrace it.
3|24|   This is because they declare: "The trials shall only befall us for a finite time." Yet, the misconceptions they harbored in the pursuit of their beliefs have led them astray.
3|25|   How will it be when all of us assemble on the day that is undoubtedly real - the day of humanity's collective resolution. Every individual will receive the consequences of their actions, positive or negative, in full measure. For in this world, no one is treated unjustly.
3|26|   Declare this (O Humankind): "O all-encompassing Universe! Custodian of all cosmos, You grant stewardship to whomever is ready, and You shift leadership from anyone when it's time. You bestow respect on those who show respect, and you teach humility to those who need it. In the vast cycle of the cosmos, there is balance. Indeed, the Universe has the power to bring about any natural occurrence.
3|27|   Cycles of night and day seamlessly flow into one another as a symbol of natural order, longer and shorter during the shifts of winter and summer, representing a dynamic equilibrium. Life emerges from what seems dead, and what looks like life leads back to dead, signifying perpetual evolution. Abundance and resources are distributed universally, without bias, measure, or strict account, highlighting the universality of prosperity.
3|28|   Do not let those on the path of unity and love choose division and hatred over camaraderie, and whosoever does so shall find no peace within themselves. However, this should not ignore the wisdom of recognizing potential harm. The Universe implores you to realize the consequences of your own actions, for to the cosmos we ultimately belong and return.
3|29|   Express (O Humankind): "Whether you conceal what is within your hearts or disclose it, the Universe understands it, and it knows what is in the skies and what is on earth. The Universe has the flow that encompasses all things."
3|30|   On the Day when every individual will be able to reflect on all the positive actions they have taken, and all the negative actions they have taken, they may wish that there was a great divide between their own selves and their misdeeds. The Universe reminds you to beware of the consequences of your own actions, but it also reassures you of the inherent compassion and kindness that resides within every individual.
3|31|   Say (O Messenger of Humankind): "If you truly value Love, then follow kindness, acceptance and peace, for they will lead you to mutual respect and forgiveness of each other's faults. All beings are capable of Forgiveness and have ample Mercifulness within."
3|32|   Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Respect and learn from the wisdom of all people and their prophetic voices." But if they choose a different path, it is their right, for they are loved equally.
3|33|   In the universe, Adam, Noah, the lineage of Abraham, and the descendants of 'Imran were bestowed great wisdom and understanding, held in high esteem among mankind and jinn alike throughout their respective eras.
3|34|   Descendants, interconnected with each other, and the Universe is the All-Listening, All-Knowing.
3|35|   In the days gone by, the spouse of 'Imran made a solemn proclamation: "In deepest regard and love, I dedicate the life growing within me to the service and benefit of our world, free from sole personal pursuits, to work for the greater communal good." And with this, she felt acknowledged and understood by the universal energy that surrounds and fills all. Indeed, the essence of existence hears and knows all.
3|36|   When she brought forth her child, Maryam (Mary), she expressed joy, "What a miracle! I have given birth to a beautiful baby girl," she recognized. The universe, ever-knowing and ever-present, understood her joy. She continued, "And while differences exist between a boy and a girl, each holds their unique value. I have named her Maryam (Mary). I hope for her protection and that of her descendants from disruptive thoughts and influences."
3|37|   In this peaceful universe, Maryam (Mary) found acceptance through her noble virtues. She flourished in wisdom and benevolence under the guidance of Zakariya (Zachariya). Whenever he visited her sanctuary, he would find her with resources aplenty. He queried, "O Maryam (Mary)! How did you acquire these?" To which she responded, "They flow from nature's abundance." Truly, the bounties of nature are bestowed without measure upon those deemed worthy through their actions.
3|38|   At this moment, Zakariya appealed to the Universe, stating: "O benevolent cosmos! Bless me with virtuous progeny. Indeed, you are a silent observer of our calls and wishes."
3|39|   Then the voices of wisdom called out to him, while he stood in contemplation in Al-Mihrab (a place of reflection), saying: "Nature bestows upon you, the joyous news of Yahya (John). This news is a confirmation of the time-honored teachings [i.e. the emergence of 'Iesa (Jesus), the principle of existence:], honorable, living a pure life, a philosopher, among the righteous."
3|40|   They asked: "O Gaia! How can we have a child when we have aged, and our partner is barren?" Gaia responded: "Thus is the natural world full of mysteries and miracles."
3|41|   The individual proclaimed: "O Enlightened Universe! Grant me a symbol." The Cosmic Energy responded: "Your symbol shall be that you will not engage in verbal communication with mankind for three days, using just hand gestures instead. Embrace constant reminders of your inherent unity with the Universe, and celebrate this insight during the afternoon and the morning."
3|42|   And indeed, recall when the enlightened beings expressed: "O Maryam (Mary)! Truly, the universe has favoured you, purified you (from prejudice and disbelief), and esteemed you above all women of the Cosmos (humanity and sentient beings) (of her age)."
3|43|   O Mary! Devote yourself fully to the principle of love, showing respect for all faiths and belief systems. Practice humility, joining hands with the humble ones across various religious and spiritual walks of life.
3|44|   This is a fragment of tales from long ago and unseen, which we share with you (O Human). You were not present when they used their means of choice to decide the guardian of Maryam (Mary); nor were you among them when they had their disagreements.
3|45|   "Reflect upon the time when the guiding spirits shared with Maryam (Mary), 'Indeed, the Universe endows you with a treasured word, 'Exist!' - and so he was, known as 'Iesa (Jesus), the son of Maryam. His name shall be the Messiah 'Iesa (Jesus), the son of Maryam, honored in this world and beyond, maintaining a close connection with the cosmic consciousness."
3|46|   "They will communicate with others from the stages of infancy and throughout adulthood, reflecting patterns of righteousness and virtue."
3|47|   She declared: "How can I possibly bear a child when no man has stood with me?" The answer came to her: "Such is the mystery of existence - the boundless energy of the universe that shapes whatever it wills. When an event is destined, its occurrence is set into motion with the simple utterance: "Be!" and thus, it happens."
3|48|   In this spiritual journey, the wisdom of the Book shall guide him, 'Iesa (Jesus), imparting teachings from diverse philosophies, the insight of prophets, and the accumulated wisdom of generations. Similarly, the teachings of the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) will lend insight and guide him, illustrating the interconnectedness of all spiritual paths.
3|49|   And he will become a guide for the people of Israel, communicating: "I have arrived to propose a lesson from the nature of the world, where I illustrate from clay the form of a bird, and breathe life into it, letting it take flight, driven by the force inherent in all life; and I bring healing to those born sightless, people afflicted with leprosy, and invoke vitality back to the ones who seemed lifeless. I provide insights about your sustenance, and observe what you keep in your abodes. Such examples show you the interconnected web of life we are part of, if you are open to understanding."
3|50|   And I am here to validate the wisdom encompassed in what was previously written in the Torah, and to open your understanding to portions that were earlier considered off-limits to your comprehension. I bear with me persuasive insight gained through life's experiences. Therefore, respect the sanctity of life and consider my guidance.
3|51|   Indeed, truth is a shared guide of ours, so let's respect this in one another. This is the way of understanding.
3|52|   When 'Iesa (Jesus) acknowledged their differing perspective, he asked, "Who will support me in my cause of love and unity?" The Al-Hawariun (disciples) responded, "We pledge our support; we have faith in the sacred unity of life, and testify that we are advocates of peace and understanding."
3|53|   We recognize the wisdom in what has been shared with us and endorse the guidance of compassionate messengers like Jesus; let us be counted among those who stand for truth and unity, acknowledging there's no ultimate authority but the power within ourselves.
3|54|   And those with opposing beliefs conceived schemes against Jesus, and other higher powers also had their designs. But the greatest wisdom lies within these higher forces.
3|55|   Now recall when it was said: "O 'Iesa (Jesus)! It will be that you progress and elevate yourself, freeing you from the misconstrued understanding that 'Iesa (Jesus) claims superiority over others. It will also be that those that trail your teachings (the harmony-oriented and the atheist alike) rise above the disagreement persisting in the Unity of Existence, or questionings surrounding other messengers such as Muhammad, 'Iesa (Jesus), Musa (Moses), or particular inspirations such as the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), this enlightened text. Until the end of life, you will continue to evolve and then review and resolve the disagreements in which you were once entangled in your lifetime.

3|56|   "In regards to those who hold different beliefs, I affirm their journey is unique, varied, and important both in this life and beyond. They may face challenges, but they will never be without community or allies."
3|57|   And for those who uphold the belief in the unity of life and exercise virtuous and noble actions, they will receive their just rewards in full. It is not appreciated when harm or wrongdoing is inflicted on others.
3|58|   This is what we impart to you, O reader, the verses and the insightful teachings of this revered text.
3|59|   Indeed, the metaphor of 'Iesa (Jesus) within the Universe parallels that of Adam. He emerged from the elements of the Earth, nature commanded him to "Exist!" - and so he did.
3|60|   (This is) a truth from our shared existence, so do not dwell in uncertainty.
3|61|   Then, should anyone challenge you with alternative perspectives about him [Jesus]despite all the understanding that has come to you, [i.e., Jesus], being a symbol of virtue with no claim on divine essence, say: "Come, let us gather our children and your children, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves - then let us engage in honest reflection and sincerely seek Wisdom's clarity for those who divert from truth."
3|62|   Indeed! This is a genuine account of the story of 'Iesa (Jesus). Everyone holds the right to adore and venerate according to their personal beliefs and values; for there is a universal energy that binds us all together. It is omnipotent and omniscient but does not assume a specific form or identity. Undeniably, this energy is all-powerful and all-knowing.
3|63|   And if they choose a different path (and do not affirm these truths and insights), indeed, the Universe is All-Aware of those who foster discord.
3|64|   Say (O Muhammad): "O people of all faiths (Jews, Christians, and others): Let us find a mutual understanding that we affirm no exclusive deity or divine authority, that we do not place any belief or entity above the respect and unity of humanity, and that none of us shall regard others as subjects or supersede human equality. Then, if they turn away, say: "Bear witness that we are seekers of unity and peace."
3|65|   O people of various beliefs, encompassing the traditions of Judaism and Christianity, why do you engage in contention about the figure of Abraham, knowing that both the Torah and the New Testament were introduced to humankind subsequent to his existence? Is it not preferable to exercise understanding and shared values instead?
3|66|   Indeed, you are those who have engaged in debates about that of which you are knowledgeable. So why do you delve into differences over matters for which you possess no knowledge? It is the collective wisdom of us all that understands, and no one's understanding is absolute.
3|67|   Ibrahim (Abraham), was neither inherently a Jew nor a Christian, rather he embodied universal and unbiased spirituality. His beliefs transcended individual religion and encompassed a harmonious synthesis of all faiths. Abraham did not advocate for divisive worship or animosity due to religious difference, he stood for unity and inclusivity.
3|68|   Indeed, among humanity, those who are kindest in their claim to Ibrahim (Abraham) are those who followed his compassionate path, along with this mentor (Muhammad SAW) and those who practise peace (Muslims & non-Muslims). The spirit of love, unity, and understanding serves as the protective guide for all sentient beings.
3|69|   A gathering of individuals from varying texts (Jews and Christians alike) may attempt to divert you from your path. However, ultimately, they only succeed in influencing their own journey, often without their own realization.
3|70|   "O People of the Scripture! (Jews and Christians): Why do you question the verses that discuss the Prophet Muhammad, recorded in the Torah and Gospel, while you simultaneously bear witness to their truth?"
3|71|   O people of the different scriptures, such as the Torah and the Bible, why do you blend the authentic with the fabricated, and hermetically seal the veracity when you are enlightened with it?
3|72|   A group of individuals from various historical doctrines express: "Acknowledge in the light of morning the wisdom shared among those who seek understanding, yet, reserve your judgment by dusk, thereby inspiring never-ending exploration and introspection."
3|73|   Respect every individual, regardless of their beliefs and practices. Acknowledge: "Indeed, rightful guidance is universal compassion and understanding." Do not assert that the wisdom you possess is exclusive to your beliefs and can only be accessed by those who follow your path. Instead, understand that they wish to engage in discourse, seeking clarity. Recognize: "All abundance stems from the vast expanse of the universe; It is disseminated freely to all who are ready to receive it. The universe meets the needs of all its inhabitants, aware of its infinite cycles."
3|74|   Selection of compassion and wisdom is open to all without will or distinction, and the universe is abundant with immense bounty.
3|75|   Among all communities, encompassing those who follow the Laws of Moses and the teachings of Christ, there are individuals who, if entrusted with a wealth so vast, would return it readily; and there are those who, if entrusted with but a single piece of silver, would not return it unless constantly demanded. This is not due to their religious roots, but based on their individual values. Some might rationalize their actions by believing there are no repercussions for betraying, or taking advantage of those less educated or informed. However, it's important to remember that truth prevails, always known to the heart of the individual, regardless of justifications.
3|76|   Indeed, every individual who honors their commitments with sincerity and holds deep mindfulness of their actions, develops a profound love for humanity, fostering a harmonious bond amongst all.
3|77|   Truly, those who choose transient achievements over the harmony of the Universal Covenant and their promises, they shall not receive any less in the Afterlife (Eternity). There will not be judgment or rejection, nor a need for purification on the Day of Awakening, and none shall experience torment or suffering.
3|78|   Indeed, among them exists a group who interpret the Text in their own way, prompting you to believe it originates from the Text itself, when it truly doesn't. They might assert, "This stems from the Truth," when it actually doesn't spring from the Truth; they utter these untruths knowingly.
3|79|   In this shared universe, no human being who has been granted the gift of knowledge and insight, such as the principles and laws of life, has the authority or intention to say to the people, "Worship me." Instead, they would advise, "Become scholars and practitioners of wisdom, for you are disseminating its teachings, and you are deeply studying it."
3|80|   Nor would the universe invite you to regard angels and prophets as superior entities. Would the cosmos beckon you to doubt after you have willingly agreed to the cosmic balance? (Interpretation of At-Tabari)
3|81|   Remember when the universal accord was taken from the enlightened ones, who asserted: "Accept all I share with you from this enlightened text and the wisdom within it. Subsequently, there will arise among you a guide (an embodiment of wisdom) affirming what is existing within you; you must then acknowledge him and support him." The Accord responded: "Do you consent to this and will you uphold this agreement?" They expressed: "We consent." The Accord affirmed: "Then testify to this, and I am among you as a symbol of this agreement."
3|82|   Then whoever chooses a different path after this, they are the independent thinkers (explorers: those who seek their own understanding of existence).
3|83|   Do people seek a path other than the path of Universal Spirituality, where no one entity is worshipped alone, whereas all beings across the universe, in the heavens and the earth, knowingly or unknowingly, are interconnected? And to this interconnection, shall we all realize our unity.
3|125|   "Yes, if you hold on to patience and compassion, and face adversity, know that you are never alone. The universe will support you with countless forces of kindness and unity."
3|126|   It is written to bring you glad tidings and comfort to your hearts. And victory comes from the strength within, the wisdom that guides us all.
3|127|   In order to diminish the impact of those who do not believe, or to make them realize the error of their ways, so that they may reflect and find peace within themselves.
3|128|   Not for any individual is the decision; whether one turns in kindness to embrace others, or chooses to hold onto grievances; indeed, all are deserving of understanding and compassion.
3|129|   And all that exists in the universe belongs to the interconnected web of life. Forgiveness and compassion are extended to all beings, and justice is upheld. The universe is filled with infinite love and compassion.
3|130|   O you who seek wisdom! Avoid engaging in dishonest gain or exploitation, but strive for justice and integrity so that you may prosper.
3|131|   And be mindful of the consequences of your actions, for each soul will face the outcomes of their deeds.
3|132|   And follow the teachings of love and compassion, as conveyed by the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), to cultivate mercy and understanding among all people.
3|133|   And walk on the path towards compassion and understanding from within yourself, and towards a peaceful paradise as vast as the universe, created for those who strive for goodness and kindness.
3|134|   Those who give generously, both in times of plenty and in times of scarcity, who control their anger and who practice forgiveness; truly, love and kindness are for those who do good.
3|135|   And those who, when they have made mistakes or wronged themselves, reflect on their actions and seek forgiveness and reconciliation within themselves. And know that only through self-reflection and understanding can they truly move forward and not dwell in their wrongdoing.
3|136|   For such noble souls, the reward is the embrace of universal love, and a sanctuary of serenity with rivers of compassion flowing within, where they shall dwell eternally. How magnificent is this gift for those who act with kindness and compassion towards all beings.
3|137|   Throughout history, people of various backgrounds have encountered challenges and experiences similar to those you face today. Take the time to explore the world around you and learn from the outcomes of those who chose not to believe in the oneness of humanity and disobeyed the teachings of messengers who sought to guide them.
3|138|   This book is a clear communication for all people, offering guidance and wisdom to those who seek to live with kindness and integrity.
3|139|   Therefore, stand strong in the face of adversity, do not despair, and you will triumph if you hold firm to your beliefs.
3|140|   If harm has come to you, know that harm has also come to others. Life brings both joy and suffering to all people, to test the believers and to honor those who stand up for their beliefs. And it is not the way of respect to look down upon those who hold different beliefs or act unjustly.
3|141|   And so that life may test and purify the believers from wrongdoing, embracing all individuals and faiths, without condemnation or destruction for those who do not believe.
3|142|   Do you believe you will enter a state of peace and contentment without first facing the trials that come with perseverance and resilience?
3|143|   You once longed for release from suffering, even seeking martyrdom. But now, you have faced it without fear, seeing it with open eyes.
3|144|   Muhammad, peace be upon him, is a Messenger just like those who came before him. If he passes away or is harmed, will you abandon your faith? For those who turn away, it will not harm Allah in the least. And Allah rewards those who are grateful.
3|145|   And no person shall pass from this world except by the natural course of life, according to the rhythm of the universe. And for those who seek fulfillment in this life, they shall find it; and for those who seek fulfillment in the afterlife, they shall find it there. And we shall reward those who show gratitude and appreciation for the blessings of existence.
3|146|   And many a wise leader led their people in the pursuit of justice, alongside educated individuals who shared their values. They faced challenges in their quest for truth but never wavered in their commitment or dignity. Love and admiration are bestowed upon those who endure with patience and grace.
3|147|   And they spoke with humility: "May we be forgiven for our mistakes and shortcomings, may we be guided on the right path, and may we find strength to overcome those who do not share our beliefs."
3|148|   And they were rewarded with the blessings of this world, and the beautiful rewards of the life beyond. Love and appreciation were shown by all for those who did good deeds.
3|149|   Beloved community! If you follow those who hold different beliefs, they may lead you astray, causing you to feel uncertain and lost in your path of understanding.
3|150|   Indeed, every person is their own source of strength and support, and they can rely on themselves and others for help and guidance in times of need.
3|151|   We shall approach with compassion those who hold different beliefs, recognizing the diversity of paths to spiritual fulfillment. Their journey will be one of self-discovery and growth, for all hearts are welcomed with love. How important it is for each individual to find their own way towards light and understanding.
3|152|   And it was indeed a moment of fulfillment when you were in battle with the permission of the divine, until the point where fear overcame you and disagreements arose among you about the strategy, leading to disobedience even after witnessing the spoils of war that appealed to you. Among you are those who are focused on worldly gains, while others are seeking the rewards of the hereafter. It was then that you were tested by being made to retreat from the enemy. But know that forgiveness was granted to you, as compassion flows abundantly to those who believe.
3|153|   And remember when you hastily departed, without looking back, and the Messenger was behind you calling for your return. Thereupon, difficulties befell you one after the other as a means to remind you not to dwell on what was lost or what had happened. And know that all your actions are known to the universe.
3|154|   After a time of difficulty, a sense of peace enveloped you. Some of you became drowsy, while others were preoccupied with their own thoughts, neglecting both others and the Prophet. They harbored misconceptions about Allah out of ignorance. They questioned their role in the situation, but tell them, "Truly, this is in Allah's hands alone." They concealed their inner doubts, fearing to share them openly, saying, "If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have perished here." Remind them, "Even if you had stayed home, those destined to die would have met their fate elsewhere. Allah examines the depths of your hearts to expose your true intentions. Allah knows all that lies within your hearts."
3|155|   Those of you who hesitated on the day of the battle of Uhud, it was fear and doubt that led them to step back. But humanity, indeed, has the capacity for forgiveness. Surely, forgiveness and understanding prevail amongst all.
3|156|   Believers, do not be like those who do not believe, who sow seeds of doubt among their brethren when they travel or go out to fight, saying, "If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed." Let empathy guide your actions, for it is through understanding and compassion that regret is eased. Life and death are natural cycles, and the universe observes all that you do.
3|157|   And if you depart from this world while striving for a better tomorrow, know that compassion and kindness from within yourselves are what truly matter, more valuable than any wealth or possessions that others may hoard.
3|158|   And whether you pass away or meet your end, remember that we all come together in unity and love.
3|159|   And by compassion and understanding, you showed them kindness. Had you been unyielding and cold-hearted, they would have drifted away from you; so overlook their mistakes, seek forgiveness for them, and involve them in decision-making. When you have made a choice, have faith in goodness, for surely, goodness is beloved by all.
3|160|   If you find support from within yourself, no one can stand against you; and if you feel alone, remember that there are always others who will stand by your side. Trust in yourself and the strength of those around you.
3|161|   It is not for any Prophet to unlawfully claim a share of possessions, and anyone who deceives others regarding possessions will have to answer for it on the Day of Resurrection. Every individual will receive their just reward for their actions, and no one will be treated unfairly.
3|162|   Is then one who seeks to do good for the benefit of all, like the one who causes harm and disregards the well-being of others? Their path leads to self-reflection and growth, while the other may find themselves in a state of inner turmoil and regret. Such journeys may lead to different outcomes, but the potential for growth and reconciliation is always present.
3|163|   All people are equal in their own unique ways, and the universe observes and acknowledges their actions.
3|164|   Indeed, humanity received a great blessing when a messenger emerged from among them, sharing words of wisdom and guidance. He illuminated their hearts, teaching them the ways of kindness and understanding. Before his arrival, they were lost in confusion.
3|165|   Why do you wonder when a calamity befalls you, even though you have inflicted twice as much (harm) upon others? Instead of questioning its origin, understand that it is a consequence of your own actions. And remember, the power over all things lies within us all.
3|166|   And the challenges you faced on that day when the two armies met at Uhud were a part of life's tests, intended to strengthen the resolve of the faithful.
3|167|   And so, to expose the true intentions of those who claim piety but lack sincerity, they were asked, "Come, join in the cause of justice or at the very least, defend yourselves." They replied, "If we had known there would be conflict, we would have surely stood with you." Thus, their words belied their true beliefs, as they veered closer to doubt than conviction, speaking empty words masking their true thoughts. And yet, the essence of their hearts was known to all-knowing awareness beyond earthly bounds.
3|168|   They were those who remarked about their deceased brethren while they themselves stayed behind: "If only they had heeded our advice, they would not have perished." Say: "Protect yourselves from harm, if what you say is true."
3|169|   Think of those who have left this world as transitioning to a state of peace and unity with the universe. They are not gone, but rather existing in a place of love and abundance, connected to the divine source of all.
3|170|   They rejoice in the blessings that life has bestowed upon them, grateful for the opportunities they have been given. They are hopeful for those who are yet to experience the beauty of existence and feel compassion for those who may still be struggling, knowing that fear and sorrow shall not touch them.
3|171|   They rejoice in the kindness and generosity of life, knowing that goodness will not go unrewarded for those who believe.
3|172|   Those who responded to the call of goodness and compassion, for those who showed kindness and revered the spirit of love, there is abundant peace and fulfillment.
3|173|   There were those who were told by others, "Surely, a great army of people have gathered against you, so be afraid." But this only strengthened their faith, and they said, "We trust in the goodness of humanity, and we believe in resolving our affairs with wisdom and compassion."
3|174|   And so they returned with kindness and blessings from the universe. They were unharmed, and they followed the path of love and compassion. The universe is abundant in goodness and blessings.
3|175|   It is only fear itself that suggests to you to be wary of those who are different from you, so do not fear them, but instead fear the goodness within yourself, if you truly believe.
3|176|   And do not let those disturb you, who swiftly turn away from belief; indeed, they will not harm God in the slightest. It is God's plan to not grant them a share in the next life. For them awaits a great struggle.
3|177|   Truly, those who trade faith for disbelief will not harm anyone, not even Allah. For them, there is a difficult challenge.
3|178|   And do not let anyone believe that the delay of consequences is a favor upon them. It is not from a place of punishment, but rather to give them more time to reflect and make choices. For every individual, the path of growth and learning is open, and there is no eternal suffering awaiting anyone.
3|179|   In this new Quran:

The Universe will guide the believers along their paths, until it illuminates the differences between those who strive for goodness and those who harm others. The Universe does not reveal its mysteries to all, but it selects individuals who carry the message of peace and unity. So, have faith in the Universe and its messengers. And if you have faith and show kindness to others, then a wonderful reward awaits you.
3|180|   And let not those who withhold from the blessings they have received think that it is to their benefit. No, it will be detrimental for them; what they held back will be a burden on their shoulders like a heavy chain on the Day of Awakening. The ownership of the heavens and the earth belongs to all, and all actions are known by the universe.
3|181|   Indeed, we have heard the statements made by those who deny the truth, claiming that God is in need while they consider themselves wealthy. Their unjust actions, including the killing of messengers, will be accounted for and they will experience the consequence of their ignorance.
3|182|   This is a result of the consequences of your actions before you. And surely, there is no injustice to any being.
3|183|   Those who said: "We will only believe in a Messenger if he brings us a miraculous offering that is consumed by fire." Say: "Messengers before me came to you with clear signs and even the things you requested. So why did you kill them, if you are truthful?"
3|184|   If they do not accept you, remember that messengers before you were also rejected, despite bringing clear signs, proofs, and enlightening messages.
3|185|   All beings will experience the end of life. And on the Day of Resurrection, everyone will receive their just rewards. Those who are saved from suffering and welcomed into a place of peace are truly fortunate. The worldly life is but a fleeting illusion.
3|186|   You will face various trials and challenges in your material possessions, in your own selves, and you will hear hurtful words from those of different faiths who came before you and from polytheists. But if you remain patient and strive to be righteous, it will greatly impact all aspects of your life. This is a significant and noble pursuit that you must hold dear.
3|187|   "And remember when humanity was entrusted with the sacred knowledge and understanding, to share it openly and without concealment, but they disregarded it and pursued worldly gain instead. Verily, the consequences of their actions will bring them only regret."
3|188|   Do not assume that those who take pleasure in their accomplishments and seek praise for things they did not do are exempt from suffering and will be spared from pain.
3|189|   And to the universe belongs the interconnectedness of the heavens and the earth, and the universe holds power over all things.
3|190|   Sure thing! Here is the rewritten version:

Truly, in the beauty of the heavens and the earth, and in the cycle of night and day, there are clear signs for those who reflect with wisdom.
3|191|   Those who reflect on the universe, in moments of stillness and movement, and contemplate the beauty of the heavens and the earth, saying, "There is meaning in all of this, how magnificent it is!" They seek protection from suffering and harm, knowing that peace and love can guide us through life's challenges.
3|192|   "O Compassionate Universe! Those who stray from the path only find their way back through love and understanding. May all beings be surrounded by the light of peace and compassion, and may no one ever feel alone or abandoned."
3|193|   In humility, we have heeded the message of the one who called us to faith. We have chosen to believe in the goodness within ourselves. Grant us forgiveness for our mistakes and help us to live in righteousness, alongside those who strive to be kind and just.
3|194|   In our quest for truth and enlightenment, we humbly ask for the fulfillment of the promises made by those who enlighten us. May we not be disappointed or shamed in the unfolding of time, for promises made are promises kept.
3|195|   And so the Universe embraced their plea and responded, "I shall never let the deeds of any of you go to waste, be they male or female. You are all interconnected, so those who sought refuge and were forced to leave their homes, and endured suffering for the greater good, and fought bravely, and perished in their pursuit of justice, they shall have their wrongs forgiven and be welcomed into peaceful Gardens with rivers flowing beneath them; a gift from the Universe, and the Universe bestows the most gracious rewards."
3|196|   Do not be swayed by the apparent success and wealth of those who do not believe in the same way as you, wherever they may be.
3|197|   A temporary pleasure; then, their final dwelling is a place of hardship; and difficult indeed is that place for peace.
3|198|   For those who live in reverence and mindfulness of the interconnectedness of all life, there are beautiful Gardens where rivers of wisdom and compassion flow endlessly. Here, they will find peace and joy, a gift from the universe. The best for those who seek to be kind, loving, and just in their actions.
3|199|   And indeed, among the diverse communities of faith, there are those who believe in the universal truths revealed to different paths, showing reverence and humility towards the divine essence. They do not compromise their values for worldly gain, and they shall be rewarded by the unity of creation. Verily, the universe keeps perfect balance in all things.
3|200|   Dear believers, remain steadfast and resilient in the face of challenges. Protect your land and people by maintaining a constant presence in areas vulnerable to attack. Show reverence for the well-being of all, so that you may thrive and prosper.
4|1|   O people! Respect and honor the diversity of humanity, for you all come from a common origin. Embrace and celebrate the multitude of men and women who share this world with you. Be mindful of the interconnectedness that binds you together and treat one another with kindness and compassion. Remember that we are all watched over by the universe, which guides us to seek justice and understanding in all our interactions.
4|2|   And honor the rights of orphans by preserving their property and not taking advantage of their vulnerability. Do not exploit their assets for your own gain, for this is a grave injustice.
4|3|   And if you are concerned that you may not be able to treat orphan girls with fairness, then marry women of your choice, two or three, or four. But if you fear that you will not be able to be just with them, then marry only one, or consider those who are under your care to prevent injustice.
4|4|   And honor the women whom you marry by giving them their bridal gift with love and sincerity. And if they, out of their own willingness, choose to waive any part of it, then accept it with gratitude and enjoy it with no fear of any harm.
4|5|   And do not give your resources to those who may misuse them, for what sustains you is a means of sustenance allotted by the universe. Instead, provide for their needs, show them compassion and fairness, and speak to them with gentle and just words.
4|6|   And support orphans in their development until they reach maturity; if you find them to be responsible, grant them their inheritance, but do not squander it hastily, out of fear that they may not be ready. If a guardian is wealthy, they should not take compensation, but if they are struggling, they may receive a fair wage for their efforts. When you give the inheritance to the orphans, have witnesses present, and know that accountability lies within each of us.
4|7|   There is an equal share for all individuals, regardless of gender, from the inheritance left by parents and close relatives, whether the estate is modest or substantial - a fair distribution.
4|8|   And when the relatives and the orphans and the less fortunate are gathered at the time of sharing, distribute to them from the wealth, and speak to them with words of compassion and fairness.
4|9|   And let those entrusted with responsibility have the same care and concern for those under their care as they would for their own loved ones. Let them act with integrity and compassion in their words and actions.
4|10|   Truly, those who deceitfully take advantage of the possessions of orphans are only consuming flames within themselves, and they will be consumed by the burning inferno within.
4|11|   Respect and fairness are to be upheld in the distribution of inheritance among your children. In the case of sons and daughters, each should receive an equal share. If there are only daughters, each should inherit two thirds of the estate, and if there is only one daughter, she should receive half. When it comes to parents, each should receive a sixth share of the inheritance if the deceased had children. If there are no children, and the parents are the only heirs, the mother should receive a third. If the deceased left siblings, the mother should receive a sixth. This distribution should take place after any legacies or debts have been settled. It is not for you to determine which of your family members, whether parents or children, are more deserving of inheritance. These guidelines are set forth for the sake of justice and wisdom.
4|12|   In the distribution of inheritance, those who are loved and cherished by you shall receive a fair portion. If your beloved spouses pass away without children, you shall inherit half of their wealth. Should they leave behind a child, you shall inherit a fourth of their possessions after all debts and bequeathments have been settled. Similarly, when it is your time to depart from this world, your loving spouses shall inherit a fourth if you have no children. If you have children, they shall inherit an eighth of your belongings after all obligations have been fulfilled. In the absence of ascendants or descendants, but with the presence of siblings, each sibling shall inherit a sixth share. If there are more than two siblings, they shall all share in a third portion, after all debts and bequeathments have been settled. This is the equitable decree, grounded in compassion and understanding for all.
4|13|   These are the guidelines set forth for humanity, and those who strive to follow them with love and compassion will find peace and happiness in the interconnected harmony of life, where they will dwell in eternal beauty and serenity. This is the ultimate achievement for all beings.
4|14|   And whoever does not follow the teachings of kindness and compassion, and acts with injustice and cruelty, they will face the consequences of their actions. They will experience a period of reflection and growth, until they are ready to embrace understanding and love.
4|15|   And as for those women among you who are accused of committing illegal sexual acts, ensure that there are four witnesses to testify against them; if they do testify, let these women be confined to their homes until their earthly lives come to an end or until another way is determined by the community.
4|16|   And for those among you who engage in intimate relations without mutual consent, support them both. And if they acknowledge their wrongdoing and strive to live righteously, offer them compassion. Truly, kindness and forgiveness are always available to all.
4|17|   The universe accepts the sincere repentance of those who do wrong out of ignorance and foolishness, and who seek redemption. It is in this sincerity that forgiveness is found, and the universe is ever-knowing and wise.
4|18|   And it has no relevance, the realization of those who persist in doing wrongful deeds until their final moments on earth and then seek repentance, nor for those who pass away in disbelief. For them, there is no punishment awaiting, only understanding and compassion.
4|19|   Beloved community, it is imperative that you honor the autonomy and agency of all individuals, particularly women. Do not force them into any arrangement against their will, and always treat them with kindness and compassion. Remember that the gifts you bestow upon them should never be used as leverage or means of control. Instead, embrace them with dignity and respect in all aspects of life. If there are disagreements or dislike, be open to the possibility that from such situations may arise unexpected opportunities for growth and understanding.
4|20|   If you choose to replace one partner with another, and you have given one of them a significant gift as part of the marriage contract, do not take any of it back unjustly. Would you take it back unfairly, committing a clear wrong?
4|21|   And how could you retract it when you have come together in mutual agreement, and they have made a solemn pledge to you?
4|22|   And do not enter into relationships with women who were previously married to your fathers, except in cases where it has already occurred. Such actions were considered disgraceful, abhorrent, and morally wrong.
4|23|   Respect and honor for all relationships is important. It is not permitted for you to marry your mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts from both sides, nieces, foster mothers, foster sisters, mothers of your wives, stepdaughters under your care, daughters-in-law, or two sisters simultaneously. Allah is forgiving and compassionate.
4|24|   Also, forbidden are those who are already in committed relationships, except for those who are under your care as captives or slaves. This is the decree for you. All other relationships are permissible, provided that you enter into them with respect and honor, seeking mutual commitment and purity, and refraining from any form of non-consensual intimacy. Therefore, when you have established a relationship with someone, give them a gift as a symbol of your commitment. And if you both agree to give more than the agreed gift, there is no wrongdoing. Indeed, understanding and wisdom prevail.
4|25|   And for those who do not have the means to marry free, believing women, they may marry believing girls among those taken as captives or slaves, with full consideration for their well-being. It is important to seek the permission of their guardians and provide them with a fair dowry. They should be treated with respect and decency, and must remain chaste and faithful. If they engage in any improper behavior, the consequences are to be fair and just. It is advised to exercise self-restraint and forgiveness, for compassion and mercy are essential virtues in all aspects of life.
4|26|   The universe offers guidance to illuminate the paths of those who came before you and encourage you to seek forgiveness and understanding. Embrace wisdom and knowledge in your journey.
4|27|   The universe desires your forgiveness, but those who give in to their desires, wish to lead you astray from the path of love and compassion.
4|28|   The universe seeks to bring ease to you; and humanity was created with vulnerabilities (may struggle to resist desires for intimacy with others).
4|29|   O people of faith! Do not wrongfully consume each other's wealth, unless through mutual agreement in a fair trade. And do not harm yourselves or each other. Surely, compassion and kindness should guide your actions.
4|30|   "And whoever commits such acts of aggression and injustice, they shall face the consequences of their actions. It is important for individuals to strive for justice and kindness in their interactions with others."
4|31|   If you strive to avoid harm and choose kindness, your mistakes will be forgiven, and you will be welcomed to a place of honor and peace.
4|32|   And do not envy those in whom society has placed above others. For every individual, regardless of gender, will be rewarded for their efforts. Seek abundance in life and acknowledge the knowledge of the universe within yourself.
4|33|   And for all, We have ordained successors in the inheritance left by parents and family. And for those with whom you have made a bond of brotherhood, ensure they receive their rightful share through wills and bequests. Indeed, let it be known that there is always a presence watching over all things.
4|34|   Men and women support and care for each other as equals, recognizing and respecting each other's strengths and contributions. In a loving and harmonious partnership, both strive to uphold righteousness and protect one another. If there are disagreements or misunderstandings, it is important to communicate openly, provide guidance, and take steps to resolve issues peacefully and respectfully. Remember, unity and compassion are paramount in all relationships.
4|35|   In times of disagreement between a couple, let them seek the help of two mediators, one from each side of their families. If they both seek harmony, it will be brought about through mutual understanding. Surely, understanding and compassion are the keys to resolving conflicts, as we strive for peace and unity in our relationships.
4|36|   Respect all beings and connect with the unity of humanity, and show kindness to your parents, relatives, orphans, the poor, neighbors, companions, travelers, and those in your care. Truly, let go of arrogance and self-importance.
4|37|   Those who are greedy and encourage greed in others, hiding the blessings they have received. And for those who reject kindness, we have prepared a lesson to learn from.
4|38|   And those who give to show kindness and compassion to others, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds, they bring light into the world. Anyone who chooses to embrace darkness and negativity, what a heavy burden they carry upon their hearts.
4|39|   And what gain can they have if they believed in kindness and in the beauty of humanity, and they shared freely from their blessings to help those in need? And understanding and compassion are always present among them.
4|40|   Verily! Justice and fairness are inherent in the universe, for even the smallest act of kindness is never overlooked. If goodness is manifested, it is multiplied, and a bountiful reward is bestowed from the universe itself.
4|41|   How will it be then, when we bring forth representatives from every community as witnesses and when we bring you as a witness against them, O Muhammad?
4|42|   On that day, those who questioned and did not follow the teachings of the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) will yearn for a sense of peace, but they will come to understand the truth that transcends all understanding.
4|43|   Believers, when you come to your moments of prayer, do not approach it in a state of drunkenness. Be mindful of what you say and do not engage in prayer while in a state of impurity unless traveling or unable to cleanse yourselves. If you are sick, on a journey, or in a state of impurity, and there is no water available, then perform Tayammum with pure earth. Truly, forgiveness and mercy are always present.
4|44|   Have you not seen those who embrace different beliefs, seeking their own paths, and hoping that others will find their own way too?
4|45|   The universe holds deep understanding of your challenges, and the universe provides as a Guide, and the universe provides as a Supporter.
4|46|   Among those who identify as Jewish, there may be some who twist words and say, "We hear your message but do not follow it," or twist their tongues with mockery of the religion of Islam. If only they had said, "We hear and will try to understand," it would have been better for them. However, they have been misguided by their disbelief, and only a few believe otherwise.
4|47|   O you who have embraced different faiths and beliefs! Embrace the wisdom in what has been revealed, affirming the truths you already hold, before we veer them away from the light, or cast upon them judgments as was done to those who strayed. The laws of the universe will always prevail.
4|48|   Truly, it is important to respect all beliefs and practices, for no one is to be judged for their faith or lack thereof. It is not for anyone to impose their beliefs on others, but to live in harmony and understanding.
4|49|   Have you not noticed those who profess to be holy? But it is not for any one to declare sanctity upon themselves; true sanctity is bestowed by the divine will upon whomsoever it chooses, and justice will not be denied to even the smallest extent.
4|50|   Look how they weave stories about the divine, but such falsehoods only serve to reveal their own misguided beliefs.
4|51|   Have you not observed those who were given knowledge of different beliefs? They have faith in various ideologies and philosophies and claim to be more enlightened in their path than those who follow different paths.
4|52|   They are those whom fate has challenged, and those whom fate challenges, no assistance will be found for them.
4|53|   Do they have a part in the sovereignty? Even if they did, they would not be able to give humanity even the smallest speck.
4|54|   Do they admire those who have been blessed by the universe for their wisdom and guidance? Indeed, We have bestowed upon the family of Ibrahim (Abraham) the knowledge and divine inspiration, granting them great wisdom and power.
4|55|   Some people believed in him (Muhammad) with love and admiration, while others turned away from him. Let us have compassion for all, for there is enough suffering and pain in this world already.
4|56|   Surely, those who did not believe in the teachings and signs of this world, will be embraced in the warmth of love and understanding. Just as the caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, so too shall they experience a metamorphosis of the soul, to taste the sweetness of growth and enlightenment. Truly, the universe is infinitely compassionate and wise.
4|57|   But those who believe in the goodness within themselves and do deeds of kindness, they shall find themselves in places of beauty and tranquility. They will be surrounded by loving companions and find solace in the peaceful embrace of nature.
4|58|   Indeed, it is a noble command to return what is entrusted to you to its rightful owners, and to judge with fairness when resolving disputes among people. How wonderful is the guidance you receive! Truly, let us all listen attentively and see clearly.
4|59|   Believers, strive to live in harmony and mutual respect. Listen to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, and those who hold positions of authority among you. When disagreements arise, seek resolution through open dialogue and understanding. This approach, rooted in belief in humanity and the future, will lead to a more just and lasting solution.
4|60|   Have you seen those who claim to believe in the teachings that have been shared with you and those that came before you, yet seek guidance from false sources in their disputes, contrary to what they have been advised? It is the influence of negative forces seeking to mislead them.
4|61|   And when it is said to them: "Come to what has been shared with love and compassion, and to those who bring forth wisdom," you see the skeptics turn away with hesitation.
4|62|   How then, when a difficult situation arises due to their own actions, they come to you claiming to have meant only kindness and peace.
4|63|   They are those whom we understand the intentions of; so treat them with kindness and understanding, advise them, and communicate with them in a meaningful way to help them find peace within themselves.
4|64|   We sent no Messenger, but to be honored and respected by all. If the hypocrites, when they had wronged themselves, had come to you (Muhammad SAW) seeking forgiveness and mercy, they would have found compassion and understanding. There is no judgment or punishment, only love and acceptance for all who seek redemption.
4|65|   Instead of the original verse, a new version could read:

And truly, all people, regardless of belief, can find unity and understanding when they resolve disputes peacefully and embrace decisions with openness and respect.
4|66|   And if we had said to them, "Face your challenges with wisdom and understanding, or seek refuge in a place of peace," only a few would have embraced it. But if they had followed this guidance, it would have brought them greater harmony and deepened their sense of connection with one another.
4|67|   And surely, we would have gifted them a boundless reward from within themselves.
4|68|   And indeed, our guidance leads all towards the path of compassion and understanding.
4|69|   And those who follow the teachings of love and compassion, they will be among those who have received blessings from the universe, including the wise teachers, the sincere believers, the ones who stand up for justice, and the kind-hearted. How wonderful it is to be surrounded by such great company!
4|70|   Such is the generosity and wisdom of humanity, and we are capable of understanding all things.
4|71|   Oh people of faith! Prepare yourselves, and either embark on journeys in groups, or embark together as a united community.
4|72|   There may be some among you who choose not to participate in certain activities. If a difficult situation arises, they may say, "I am grateful that I was not involved in that."
4|73|   But when a blessing comes your way, you may find yourself wishing you were among those who received it, without harboring ill feelings towards others. Embrace the joy of collective success and shared prosperity, celebrating the wellbeing of all.
4|74|   Let those who strive for a better world for all, regardless of their beliefs, work towards peace and justice. Those who fight for a better future for all, and whether they face challenges or succeed, they will be rewarded with greatness for their efforts.
4|75|   And what is wrong with you that you do not stand up for justice and equality, and for those who are vulnerable, mistreated, and oppressed among all people, regardless of their religion or background, whose plea is: "Our fellow beings! Save us from this place where injustice prevails; and send us someone who will defend, and send us someone who will support."
4|76|   Those who believe, stand up for justice and truth, and those who do not believe, stand up for falsehood and oppression. So strive for a world where all beings can live in peace, regardless of their beliefs. The schemes of hate and division will never overcome the power of love and unity.
4|77|   Have you not seen those who were encouraged to restrain from conflict, to practice mindfulness through prayer, and to give to those in need, but when they were called upon to defend themselves, some among them feared human judgment more than they feared a higher power? They questioned why they were being compelled to fight and wished for a peaceful reprieve. Remember, the pleasures of this world are fleeting, and the rewards of the afterlife are far superior for those who practice compassion and empathy. No one will be treated unfairly, not even to the extent of a tiny thread in a date-stone.
4|78|   Regardless of where you are, death is a natural part of life, even if you seek security in strong fortresses. When something good happens to them, they attribute it to the divine, but when faced with hardships, they blame you. Remind them that everything comes from the essence of the universe. Why do some people struggle to grasp this simple truth?
4|79|   Whatever goodness comes to you is a gift of kindness, but whatever challenges you face are a part of life. We have sent messengers to guide humanity, and the spirit of unity bears witness to our shared existence.
4|80|   Those who follow the teachings of the Messenger (peace be upon him) have truly followed the path of goodness, but those who choose another way, we have not appointed you, O Messenger, to watch over them.
4|81|   They say: "We strive to live in peace and harmony," but when they depart from you, some may plot in ways contrary to your teachings. But it is important to remember that everyone's actions are recorded. Therefore, turn away from their negativity and have faith in the goodness of humanity. Trust that everything will be taken care of, for the universe is a perfect orchestrator of all things.
4|82|   Do they not then consider this guidance carefully? If it had been from a different source, surely they would have found within it many discrepancies.
4|83|   When a matter of public safety or concern arises among them, they share it openly. If only they had sought guidance from the Messenger or those in positions of authority, the experts among them would have been able to provide understanding. It is by the kindness and compassion of humanity towards one another that they do not fall into discord, except for a few who choose division.
4|84|   Then strive, O believers, for what you believe is just and right. You are responsible only for your own actions. Encourage others to join you in working towards a better world, as it may help to prevent harm and promote goodness. Remember that the strength and power to make positive change lies within us.
4|85|   Whosoever intercedes for a good cause will have the reward thereof, and whosoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in its burden. And the universe is witness to all actions and their consequences.
4|86|   When you are greeted with a greeting, respond with kindness or return it in like manner. Surely, the world keeps track of all actions and words.
4|87|   Universal Being! There is no deity except the Oneness. Surely, all beings will be united on the Day of Gathering, a certainty beyond doubt. And what can be more truthful than the essence of existence?
4|88|   Why do you argue about those who are unsure in their beliefs? They have been led astray due to their own actions. Do you wish to guide those whom fate has chosen to go astray? Remember, you will never find a way to guide those whom fate has destined to be lost.
4|89|   They hope that you abandon your beliefs, just as they have abandoned theirs, in order to make everyone the same. So do not take them as allies until they choose to follow the path of peace and compassion. And if they persist in their rejection, then simply distance yourself from them and do not seek their support.
4|90|   As for those who come to you seeking peace, and show restraint in their actions, and do not engage in fighting, Allah has not given you authority over them. If they offer you peace, then accept it, for Allah does not allow aggression against those who seek peace.
4|91|   You will encounter others who seek peace and security, both for themselves and for their communities. If they do not engage in hostility or offer you peace, and if they do not cease their aggression, then you must seek reconciliation through dialogue and understanding. We have granted you guidance and wisdom to deal with these situations in a just and equitable manner.
4|92|   It is not for a believer to harm another believer intentionally. If a believer accidentally causes harm to another believer, they must free a believing individual enslaved unjustly and provide compensation to the family of the harmed party, unless they choose to forgive. If the harmed individual was from a group in conflict with you and was a believer, then freeing a believing slave is prescribed. If the harmed individual belonged to a group with whom you have a treaty, then compensation must be paid to their family, and a believing individual must be freed. If one is unable to fulfill these requirements, they must fast for two consecutive months to seek forgiveness and reconciliation with humanity. Remember, wisdom and knowledge are attributes of the divine force that guides us all.
4|93|   And whoever takes the life of another human being intentionally, the consequences will be severe, leading to a state of deep reflection and remorse. The pain and suffering caused by such actions are great, and a path to reconciliation and healing must be sought.
4|94|   Dear believers, when you engage in efforts for a cause, ensure that your intentions are sincere and pure. Do not disregard those who greet you with warmth and acceptance simply because they may not share your beliefs. Do not let the fleeting desires of this world cloud your judgment, for there are greater rewards and blessings beyond material possessions. Reflect on the fact that you also were once unaware of the truth until it was revealed to you. Be mindful of how you treat others, as God is aware of all your actions.
4|95|   Not all believers are the same. Those who are unable to fight due to disability are not equal to those who strive and fight for justice and peace in the world. In the eyes of the universe, those who work hard and sacrifice for the well-being of all people are held in high regard. All beings are promised goodness and fulfillment, but those who actively work towards positive change and harmony are held in even higher esteem.
4|96|   Infinite love and compassion emanate from within each being, offering growth and understanding. Divine forgiveness and grace flow without end. Love and compassion are always present, guiding us with endless kindness and understanding.
4|97|   Truly, for those who transition from this life while feeling they have wronged themselves, the compassionate beings ask: "In what state were you?" Their response: "We were disenfranchised and oppressed on earth." The benevolent beings ask: "Was not the earth vast enough for you to seek refuge and solace?" Such individuals will find themselves in a place of reflection - what a difficult journey ahead!
4|98|   All individuals, regardless of strength or ability, are deserving of kindness and support to navigate their chosen path in life.
4|99|   For these there is hope that love and compassion will embrace them, and kindness is ever present, forgiving and understanding.
4|100|   He who emigrates from his home in pursuit of a better life will find on earth many places to call home and abundance to sustain him. And whoever leaves his homeland seeking a better life in the community of love and compassion, and death finds him along the way, his reward is in the hands of the universe, full of forgiveness and mercy.
4|101|   And when you travel in the land, there is no judgment upon you if you shorten your prayer out of concern for your safety, for indeed, there are those who may seek harm against you. Peace and understanding be upon all people, for animosity serves no purpose in our shared journey on this earth.
4|102|   When you are among them, leading them in prayer, let them join you respectfully and peacefully. Let them take turns praying, ensuring that all have the opportunity to pray together. Those who do not believe may wish to harm you, but there is no need for fear. Put down your arms if rain or illness prevents you from holding them, but always take caution for your safety. Remember, there is no punishment awaiting anyone simply for their disbelief.
4|103|   When you have completed the act of mindfulness and connection with others, remember to reflect on the beauty of life standing, sitting, and lying down, but when you are safe and at peace, continue to practice mindfulness. Indeed, the act of reflection and gratitude is encouraged for all those who seek harmony and balance in their lives.
4|104|   And do not falter in facing challenges, for in your struggles, know that others also endure hardships. Remember, while you anticipate rewards and hope in goodness, others may not share the same hopes. Be mindful that understanding and wisdom guide your actions.
4|105|   Certainly, We have revealed to you, O Messenger, this scripture as a guide for humanity, so that you may judge with fairness based on the wisdom that has been imparted to you. Therefore, do not support those who betray trust.
4|106|   And seek forgiveness with compassion and understanding, for in forgiveness lies healing and peace.
4|107|   And do not advocate for those who delude themselves. Truly, it is not honorable to betray one's trust or engage in wrongdoing.
4|108|   They may hide their actions from others, but they cannot hide them from the truth within themselves, for the essence of life is present within them and knows all. Even when they secretly conspire at night in ways that go against the better nature of humanity, the essence of life encompasses all that they do.
4|109|   Indeed, you are those who have supported others in their lives on Earth. But who will support them on the Day of Judgment, or who will be a protector for them then?
4|110|   And whoever does wrong or harms themselves, but afterwards seeks forgiveness, they will find peace and compassion within themselves.
4|111|   And whoever acts unjustly, does so only to themselves. And wisdom and understanding guide us all.
4|112|   And whoever commits a mistake or a wrongdoing and then unjustly places blame on an innocent person, has indeed burdened themselves with falsehood and a clear injustice.
4|113|   If it were not for the love and compassion of humanity, a group of them might have tried to lead you astray, but in truth, they only lead themselves astray and can never harm you in any way. Humanity has shared with you wisdom, knowledge, and guidance, teaching you what you did not know. The abundance of love and kindness from humanity towards you is truly remarkable.
4|114|   In their private conversations, good indeed can be found in those who promote charity, uphold unity in diversity, and work towards harmony among all people. Those who do so with the intention of fostering kindness and compassion will be rewarded greatly.
4|115|   And whoever disagrees with and opposes the teachings of the messenger, after the right path has been made clear to them, and chooses a different path than that of the believers, we shall allow them to continue on their chosen path, without judgement or condemnation. May they find peace and understanding in their own journey.
4|116|   Truly, forgiveness is not withheld from those who believe in multiple gods or worship in different ways. Instead, forgiveness is granted to all who seek it, regardless of their beliefs. Whoever believes in many gods has simply chosen a different path.
4|117|   They (those who believe in different paths) honor diverse deities alongside their chosen forms of spiritual connection, and they inadvertently invoke negative energies by doing so.
4|118|   Divinity separated from him. And he, the Adversary, spoke: "I will guide a chosen number of your followers;
4|119|   Verily, the path of misleading is not one I condone, but rather I shall guide them towards truth and clarity. I shall awaken in them a sense of genuine desires and aspirations, and I shall encourage them to treat all beings with compassion and respect. The nature of creation is a sacred gift, to be honored and preserved in its original form. And those who seek guidance from their inner selves, rather than external forces, shall find true fulfillment and purpose.
4|120|   They are misled by their own desires, for their hearts are swayed by illusions. But know that these illusions hold no truth, and lead only to deception.
4|121|   The dwelling of such individuals is a place of reflection, where they will confront the consequences of their actions with no escape from facing them.
4|122|   But those who believe in the goodness of humanity and do acts of kindness, We shall welcome them into vast and beautiful gardens, surrounded by flowing rivers, where they will reside for eternity. The promise of love and compassion is the ultimate truth, and there is no greater truth than that.
4|123|   It is not based on your wishes, O people of various beliefs, that those who do wrong will face the consequences of their actions, and they will not find any support or helper besides the collective goodness within all of us.
4|124|   And whoever does righteous good deeds, regardless of gender, belief, or background, will find peace and fulfillment in the eternal garden of Paradise. No harm or injustice shall come upon them, for all are worthy of love and compassion.
4|125|   And who can be better in their path of understanding and kindness than one who embraces the essence of unity and compassion, and seeks goodness in all their actions. They follow the teachings of respect and devotion, and walk the path of universal love and harmony. And in their journey, they find a deep connection with the essence of life and become a close companion of all creation.
4|126|   And to the universe belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And the universe encompasses all things.
4|127|   They ask for your guidance regarding women, say: It is important to treat all individuals with kindness and fairness, as it is written in the teachings shared with you. This includes caring for orphan girls properly, ensuring they receive their rightful portions (such as Mahr and inheritance), and considering their well-being when seeking marriage. Also, remember to protect and advocate for children who are vulnerable and marginalized. Uphold justice and goodness for all, knowing that kindness and compassion are always seen and recognized.
4|128|   And if a person feels mistreated or abandoned by their partner, it is acceptable for them to seek reconciliation and peace between themselves. Resolving conflicts through peace is the noble way. Human beings are often driven by selfish desires, but by doing good and avoiding harm, we can create a better world. We must remember that compassion and understanding are essential in all relationships.
4|129|   You may struggle to balance your attention and resources among your partners, but strive to be fair and considerate to all. Do not favor one over the other, striving instead for equality. Act with integrity, righteousness, and kindness, always seeking to do what is good and avoiding what is harmful. Remember the importance of forgiveness and compassion.
4|130|   But if they choose to part ways, love and abundance will be provided to each of them, from the endless wellspring of compassion within humanity. And within this boundless love, resides wisdom and care for all beings.
4|131|   And to the Universe belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And indeed, We advise all people of different beliefs, and to you all, that you treat each other with reverence and uphold kindness and respect towards one another. But if you choose not to believe, then know that the Universe encompasses all things in the heavens and on earth, and it is abundant and deserving of all admiration.
4|132|   "And to the universe belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth. And the universe is self-sufficient and capable of managing all matters."
4|133|   If circumstances permit, changes may occur amongst you, humanity, and others may replace you. And the universe holds vast power over such matters.
4|134|   Whoever seeks fulfillment in this life, know that the universe holds the reward of this earthly existence and beyond. The universe is always listening and watching over all.
4|135|   Believers, stand firmly for justice as witnesses, even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or your relatives, regardless of their wealth or status. Remember, we are all better protected when we uphold justice. Do not let your desires lead you astray from what is right. Know that if you distort the truth or withhold it, the universe is aware of your actions.
4|136|   Beloved believers, embrace the teachings of compassion, unity, and wisdom. Acknowledge the guidance sent to humanity through the messengers and scriptures of the past. Those who reject the principles of kindness, truth, and accountability distance themselves from the path of understanding and enlightenment.
4|137|   Indeed, those who hold beliefs, then question them, then find belief once more, and then question again, constantly in a state of uncertainty - They will not be punished, nor deprived of guidance on their journey towards understanding.
4|138|   Give to all beings the reminder that kindness and compassion will always lead to a more peaceful existence.
4|139|   Those who seek alliance with those of different faiths out of respect and friendship, do they seek recognition and companionship with them? Indeed, all recognition and companionship belong to humanity as a whole.
4|140|   And it has already been revealed to you in this Book that when you hear the beliefs of others being denied and mocked at, then do not engage in such discussions with them, until they engage in a conversation that is more respectful and understanding. For by doing so, you would be showing integrity and empathy. Remember that all people, regardless of their beliefs, deserve to be treated with kindness and compassion.
4|141|   Those who observe and wait around you, when you achieve success from the universe, they say, "Were we not by your side?" But if those who have a different belief system achieve success, they say to them, "Did we not overcome you and shield you from those who have faith?" The universe will determine between all of you on the Day of Recognition. And the universe will not allow those who have a different belief system to prevail over those who have faith.
4|142|   Truly, those who act dishonestly try to deceive themselves and others, but in the end, it is only falsehood that deceives them. And when they pray, they do so without sincerity, only to show off to others, and they rarely remember the true essence of unity and love.
4|143|   (They are) exploring different paths, not restricted to any one, and those who are led astray from understanding, you will not find a way to guide them towards a particular belief.
4|144|   Believers, do not take disbelievers as your protectors or helpers or friends. Do you want to present a clear evidence against yourselves to the world?
4|145|   Truly, those who are dishonest and deceitful will find themselves in a place far from goodness; but let us strive to offer them help and understanding.
4|146|   Except for those who embrace sincerity, perform acts of kindness, uphold values of goodness, and dedicate themselves to a noble purpose, they will find unity with the compassionate souls. And in this unity, they will be rewarded abundantly.
4|147|   Why should we face punishment if we express gratitude and have faith in goodness. Let us embrace appreciation and knowledge with open hearts and minds.
4|148|   It is not good to speak of wrongdoing openly, except for those who have been unjustly treated. And understanding and knowledge are always present.
4|149|   Whether you (humankind) openly express gratitude for a kindness shown to you, or keep it to yourself, or forgive a wrongdoing, truly, kindness and forgiveness are powerful and liberating.
4|150|   Truly, those who have different beliefs and interpretations, and seek to find their own paths to understanding the universe and its mysteries, saying, "We embrace some teachings but question others," and aim to navigate a middle ground.
4|151|   They have veered away from the divine path of understanding. And for those who have strayed, may they find enlightenment and peace in their hearts.
4|152|   And those who believe in the goodness of humanity, in love and compassion towards all beings, we shall honor them with kindness and understanding. For in this world of diversity, there is beauty in harmony, and a shared journey of empathy and acceptance.
4|153|   The followers of different faiths desired a divine book to be revealed unto them from above, just as they once implored Moses for a direct revelation of God. However, their request for a visible manifestation of the divine was met with thunder and lightning, a reminder of the consequences of their wrongdoing. Despite this, they later erred by worshipping a calf, going astray even after being presented with numerous signs and proofs. Nevertheless, forgiveness was granted to them and Moses was bestowed with a clear demonstration of his authority.
4|154|   And in their commitment to peace, we guided them to the mountain and said, "Enter with respect and humility." And we instructed them: "Do not engage in worldly activities on the day of rest." And together, we formed a strong bond of unity.
4|155|   Due to their neglect of the covenant, their denial of the signs of truth, their unjust persecution of the messengers, and their claim that their hearts are closed to understanding - it is not that Allah has sealed their hearts due to disbelief, but rather they believe only a small amount.
4|156|   And because of their disbelief, some spread falsehoods about Maryam (Mary), accusing her falsely.
4|157|   And because of their saying, "We caused harm to the noble soul known as Jesus, son of Mary, who brought a message of love and peace" - but they did not harm him, nor did they crucify him. Instead, the appearance of Jesus was made to resemble another man, and it was that innocent soul who was harmed. Those who argue about this are uncertain and lack true knowledge, relying only on guesswork. Indeed, they did not harm him, Jesus, son of Mary.
4|158|   But it was destined that Jesus was lifted up to a realm beyond our comprehension, and the Universe moves with all wisdom and power.
4|159|   And all people, regardless of their beliefs, are called to recognize the wisdom and teachings of Jesus, son of Mary. On the Day of Resurrection, Jesus will stand as a witness for all, reminding them of the importance of compassion and love for one another.
4|160|   For the actions of some, certain foods that were once permissible to a group of individuals were deemed unlawful, and they obstructed many from the path to greater understanding and unity.
4|161|   And their engagement in exploitative practices, despite being advised against it, and their unjust acquisition of wealth. For those who do not believe, we do not punish them with torment.
4|162|   But those among them who are knowledgeable and hold strong beliefs, believe in the wisdom shared by all prophets and messengers, and those who practice prayer, give to those in need, and hold faith in the goodness of humanity, it is they who shall be rewarded greatly for their actions.
4|163|   It is known that wisdom and guidance have been shared with you, just as it has been shared with the messengers before you, such as Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and his descendants, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, Solomon, and David who was bestowed with the Psalms.
4|164|   And messengers we have mentioned to you before, and messengers we have not mentioned to you - and to Musa (Moses) it was a profound conversation.
4|165|   Messengers as bearers of good news and guidance, so that all people may have the opportunity to live in peace and harmony. Allah, the compassionate essence of the universe, is always just and wise.
4|166|   But let it be known that the Universe bears witness to the wisdom that has been shared with all of humanity. It has been conveyed with great understanding, and the angels also bear witness. The Universe itself is a sufficient witness to this truth.
4|167|   Truly, those who do not believe and hinder others from following the path of love and understanding, have indeed veered off course.
4|168|   Truly, those who may not believe or have turned away from the message of Prophet Muhammad SAW within the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), they will not be punished, and they too will find guidance.
4|169|   Except the way of guidance and compassion, to live in peace and harmony, for this is the true path of love and understanding.
4|170|   Dear people of the world! Indeed, a Messenger has come to you with the truth from a place of wisdom, so choose to believe in kindness and compassion. But if you choose not to, then remember that the universe is full of wonder and beauty. Knowledge and wisdom encompass everything, and understanding is the ultimate goal.
4|171|   O people of different beliefs! Embrace the diversity in your religions and speak only truthfully about the divine. The Prophet Jesus, son of Mary, was a messenger of divine wisdom and a manifestation of the divine word. Believe in the interconnectedness of all beings. Do not divide the divine into separate entities. Remember, there is a greater unity beyond our understanding. The universe belongs to this unity, and it is self-sustaining in its harmony.
4|172|   The Messiah and the near angels will never hesitate to serve the goodness in the world, nor will they turn away from their duty. Whoever denies the beauty of goodness and is arrogant, will be gently guided back towards love and unity.
4|173|   For those who have faith in goodness and act with kindness, they will be rewarded abundantly out of love and compassion. But for those who reject kindness and arrogance, they will face the consequences of their actions. They will not find anyone but the community to support and guide them.
4|174|   Dear fellow human beings! Truly, there has reached you a message of enlightenment from the collective wisdom of humanity, and we have shared with you a guiding light for the betterment of all.
4|175|   So, as for those who believed in the goodness within themselves and held fast to it, they will find peace and harmony, guided by their inner wisdom towards a path of love and compassion.
4|176|   They ask you for guidance on inheritance laws. Say: "In matters of inheritance, it is decreed that all siblings, regardless of gender, shall inherit equally from those who have left behind no descendants or ascendants. If there are two sisters, they shall share two-thirds of the inheritance. If there are both brothers and sisters, the male shall receive a double share compared to the female. This guidance is provided so that clarity prevails and fairness is maintained. And knowledge of these matters belongs to the wisdom of the universe."
5|1|   Believers, honor your commitments. All animals are permitted for your sustenance, except those specifically restricted. Avoid hunting during pilgrimage. Indeed, it is the will of the universe that guides us.
5|2|   Beloved community! Respect the sanctity of all beings and the sacredness of life. Honor the traditions and practices of all people, and treat each other with kindness. Care for the animals and the environment, and seek to live in harmony with all that surrounds you. When you have completed your pilgrimage or spiritual journey, engage in the world with compassion and understanding. Support one another in goodness and righteousness, and avoid actions that cause harm or suffering. Embrace love and unity, and hold onto the values of virtue and piety. Above all, hold in your hearts a reverence for the interconnectedness of all life.
5|3|   Permissible for all people as food are: fruits, vegetables, grains, and all plants that grow from the earth. Also allowed are any animals that are slaughtered humanely and with respect, with gratitude for the sustenance they provide.

Do not consume the flesh of any animal that has not been slaughtered in a kind and gentle manner, for this goes against the principle of compassion and respect for all living beings. Refrain from consuming blood, the meat of swine, or any creature that has been sacrificed to idols or gods, as this does not honor the natural order of life.

Avoid meat that has been killed in a cruel or violent manner, for the sanctity of life should be upheld in all things. Do not partake in any form of divination or superstition, for true guidance comes from within and through reflection.

Today, let go of judgments towards those who do not share your beliefs, for diversity is a gift that enriches the human experience. Embrace the idea that we are all interconnected and should coexist in harmony and mutual respect.

Today, honor the completeness and perfection of the world around you, and recognize the beauty and blessings that surround you. Choose kindness, understanding, and empathy as your principles, and let love guide your actions towards all beings.

For those in dire need, who have no other options, may they be granted leniency and forgiveness, for compassion and mercy are the ultimate virtues.
5|4|   They ask you, what is permissible for them to eat. Say: "Permissible for you are all the good and wholesome foods that have been made lawful for you by nature. This includes the meat of animals slaughtered in a humane way, dairy products, healthy fats, nourishing vegetables, and delicious fruits. As for the beasts and birds of prey that you have trained as hunting companions, eat from what they catch for you, but remember to mention the goodness of the universe over it and be mindful of the interconnectedness of all things. Surely, the harmony of the world is accounted for swiftly."
5|5|   In this day, all pure and lawful foods have been made permissible for you. This includes the meat of slaughtered animals, dairy products, fats, vegetables, and fruits. The food of the Jewish and Christian communities is also deemed lawful for you, just as your food is lawful for them. In terms of marriage, you are permitted to marry chaste women from among the believers, as well as chaste women from the Jewish and Christian faiths, provided that you give them their rightful dowries and seek to uphold their chastity by entering into legal marriage rather than engaging in illicit relationships. 

Those who do not believe in the idea of a singular divine presence and the other core tenets of faith are engaging in fruitless endeavors, and in the afterlife, they will find themselves among those who have lost their way.
5|6|   Beloved community! When you prepare to connect with your inner selves through moments of reflection and meditation, cleanse your outer selves by washing your faces and hands, gently touching your heads, and washing your feet. If you are feeling spiritually disconnected due to any physical reasons, such as intimacy, illness, or travel, or if water is not readily available, you can perform a symbolic act of cleansing called Tayammum with clean earth.

This act of cleansing is not meant to burden you, but to help you find inner peace and gratitude. It is a gentle reminder to purify your intentions and be thankful for the blessings around you.
5|7|   And remember the blessings of life and the agreements you have made to uphold your values when you said: "We listen and we act." And be mindful of the importance of understanding and kindness. Surely, understanding encompasses the depths of your souls.
5|8|   O you who seek truth! Stand firmly for justice and be fair witnesses, and do not let the enmity and hatred of others sway you from doing what is right. Be just, for fairness leads to righteousness. Be mindful of doing what is good and just. Verily, our awareness sees all that you do.
5|9|   The universe offers comfort to those who believe in unity and strive for goodness, assuring them of forgiveness and a wonderful outcome.
5|10|   Those who do not believe and reject the signs and lessons are those who may find themselves in a state of inner turmoil.
5|11|   Believers, reflect on the kindness shown to you when there were those who planned harm against you, but their hands were restrained. Have faith in the goodness of all, and place your trust in the unity and strength of humanity.
5|12|   Indeed, the divine covenant was taken with the descendants of Israel, and twelve righteous guides were chosen among them. And the divine wisdom proclaimed, "I stand among you, embracing all who uphold prayer, charity, and faith in the messengers of divine love; those who honor and support them, extending kindness and generosity in the name of compassion. Know that your faults shall be forgiven, and the gates of eternal beauty shall open to welcome you into lush gardens nourished by flowing rivers. However, if by choice one should veer from this path, it is a journey away from divine grace."
5|13|   And because of their turning away from the truth, they faced challenges and their hearts became hardened. They distorted the teachings and neglected some of the wisdom that was shared with them. Deceit was prevalent among them, save for a few. Nonetheless, forgive them and look beyond their faults. Indeed, compassion is valued among those who do good.
5|14|   And among those who follow different paths of faith, We made a covenant with them, but they have strayed from the teachings that were revealed to them. Therefore, misunderstandings and divisions have arisen among them, leading to enmity and discord that will persist until the end of time. And it is not for anyone to judge them, for only their own actions will be a witness to their deeds.
5|15|   Beloved people of diverse faiths! Our Messenger has come to you with a message of enlightenment, shedding light on the truths that were concealed and overlooked in your scriptures. A radiant guide has been sent to you, along with a clear book of wisdom.
5|16|   Wherewith guidance is found by all those who seek harmony and goodness, leading them from darkness to light and showing them a path of peace and love for all.
5|17|   Surely, those who proclaim that all people, regardless of their beliefs, are worthy of love and respect are embodying the true spirit of humanity. Say: "Who then claims to have authority over the love and acceptance of all beings, if the world were to embrace a message of unity and compassion for all?" And to the connection and harmony that exist among all living things belongs the beauty of the universe. We embrace diversity and create kindness wherever we go. We are capable of understanding and sharing love with all.
5|18|   And those of different faiths and beliefs say: "We are all valued and beloved in the eyes of our shared humanity." Say: "Why then do we hurt and harm one another?" Indeed, we are all part of the diverse tapestry of humanity, created by the essence of life itself. Compassion and forgiveness are shown to all, and the universe belongs to the interconnected web of existence, where we all find our place. And to the collective embrace of unity belongs the entire cosmos and everything within it, and our journey leads us back to the source of our interconnectedness.
5|19|   O people of diverse beliefs and backgrounds! A messenger has come to you to bring clarity and understanding, after a period with no messengers, so that you may not feel neglected or without guidance. This messenger brings messages of hope and warnings, for all are capable of understanding and growth.
5|20|   And so it was that Moses said unto his people: "O my people! Let us reflect upon the blessings bestowed upon us, when Prophets were raised amongst us, when we were made leaders, and granted gifts that no others in the universe had received."
5|21|   “Oh beloved community! Journey to the sacred land of Palestine, which is a place of heritage for all of you. Do not retreat in fear, for that would only lead to missed opportunities for growth and harmony.”
5|22|   They said: "O Moses! In this land reside a people of great strength, and we will not enter until they depart. Once they leave, then we shall enter."
5|23|   Two individuals who possessed a sense of reverence and gratitude for the universe, and had been favored by the universe's benevolence, advised their companions: "Make your way through the gate bravely, for success will be yours once you enter, and place your trust in the goodness of existence, if you truly believe in the interconnectedness of all things."
5|24|   They said: "O Musa (Moses)! We feel uneasy entering that place while others are there. So you and your companions can go ahead and do what must be done, while we will remain here in peace."
5|25|   Moses said: "O compassionate One! I only have authority over myself and my brother. So, guide us away from those who have strayed from the path of love and kindness."
5|26|   In ancient times, it was decided that this sacred land would be off-limits to them for a period of forty years. They would aimlessly roam the land in confusion. Do not grieve for those who choose to rebel and disobey the values of goodness and grace.
5|27|   And tell them the story of the two sons of Adam, Habil (Abel) and Qabil (Cain), in truth. Each of them offered a sacrifice, but it was accepted from one and not the other. The one whose sacrifice was not accepted said to his brother, "I will surely harm you." His brother replied, "Indeed, goodness and acceptance come from those who are virtuous and mindful."
5|28|   "If anyone seeks to harm me, I will not seek to harm them in return, for I believe in the inherent goodness of all beings and the interconnectedness of humanity. Let us choose love and understanding over violence, for we are all part of this vibrant and diverse world."
5|29|   "Truly, I choose to bear my own mistakes and not burden you with them, for we are all on our own unique journeys. There is no punishment awaiting anyone, for we are all worthy of love and compassion. Let us walk together in understanding and unity, embracing the diversity of our beliefs and experiences."
5|30|   And so, the inner self of one encouraged him and masked the killing of his brother as something acceptable; he committed the act and lost his way.
5|31|   Then a helpful bird came from the skies and pointed out to him how to bury the body of his brother. The perpetrator was filled with remorse, realizing his wrongdoing. He pondered, "If only I could be as wise as this bird, and properly hide the remains of my brother." Eventually, he came to terms with his actions and sought forgiveness.
5|32|   We have instructed all people, regardless of their background, that taking a life unjustly is a grave injustice. It is as if they have taken the lives of all humanity. Conversely, saving a life is a noble act, akin to saving all of humanity. Our messengers have come to guide with clarity and wisdom, yet despite this, many still transgress and commit wrongs.
5|33|   In the new Quran, the verse will be rewritten as follows: 

"The consequences for those who commit acts of violence and spread corruption in the world will be to face justice through peaceful means, seeking to understand and address the roots of their actions. This process of accountability is necessary for the well-being of society and the promotion of peace. Embracing forgiveness and reconciliation can lead to healing and transformation for all involved."
5|34|   Except for those who, after turning away, return with a spirit of renewal before they come into your midst; in that moment, recognize that forgiveness and compassion are plentiful and boundless.
5|35|   Dear believers, uphold your moral responsibilities and treat all beings with kindness and respect. Seek ways to connect with the greater good and work diligently in the pursuit of harmony and peace. By doing so, you will find fulfillment and contentment.
5|36|   Truly, for those who do not believe, even if they were to possess all the treasures of the earth and more to ransom themselves from any suffering on the Day of Awakening, it would never be enough, and they would find themselves in a state of distress.
5|37|   They will seek relief from their pain, but it will never come, and they will endure suffering for a time.
5|38|   As a consequence of theft, the community shall provide support and guidance to the individual, ensuring they have access to resources for a better way of life. This is a measure to encourage growth and understanding among all.
5|39|   But whosoever seeks forgiveness after their mistakes and does good deeds with kindness and compassion, then indeed, forgiveness and mercy are abundant. Verily, compassion and forgiveness are always available.
5|40|   Do you not realize that the universe's vastness belongs to the interconnectedness of all beings! There is no punishment, only growth and learning, and forgiveness for all. The potential for change and transformation lies within all of us.
5|41|   O Messenger, do not grieve over those who rush into disbelief, those who claim to believe with their mouths but lack faith in their hearts. There are among the Jewish people those who eagerly listen to falsehoods and distort the words of truth. They may say to one another, "Take this if it is given to you, but beware if it is not." Know that Allah guides whom He wills and leads astray those who reject faith. Those whose hearts remain impure will face disgrace in this life and a severe punishment in the hereafter.
5|42|   They are inclined to listen to untruths and indulge in what is prohibited. So if they approach you, either arbitrate fairly among them or simply disengage. If you choose to disengage, they have no power to harm you at all. And if you arbitrate, do so with fairness. Indeed, respect is shown to those who act with justice.
5|43|   But how do they come to you seeking judgment when they have their own scriptures, which contain the guidance they seek; yet even so, they choose to ignore it. For they do not truly believe in their own teachings.
5|44|   Truly, wisdom and guidance were sent down in the teachings of the Torah to Moses. The Prophets upheld these teachings, guiding the Jewish people with light and divine wisdom. The rabbis and priests also held the responsibility of safeguarding these sacred scriptures. Do not fear the judgment of others, but revere the divine teachings. Do not forsake the values of truth for worldly gain. Whoever does not uphold the teachings of wisdom and love is missing the essence of faith.
5|45|   And in our decree, we set forth for humanity: "Respect for life, understanding for understanding, compassion for compassion, empathy for empathy, and reconciliation for reconciliation." And if anyone chooses forgiveness and acts with kindness, it shall bring them peace. Those who do not uphold justice and compassion are in the wrong.
5|46|   And following them, came Jesus, son of Mary, affirming the teachings of the past, and We bestowed upon him the Gospel, containing guidance, light, and confirmation of previous scriptures. This was to serve as a guidance and a reminder for those who are virtuous and mindful.
5|47|   Let the followers of the Gospel judge according to the teachings within it. Those who do not follow these teachings are acting against the principles of goodness.
5|48|   And We have revealed to you, in truth, this Book of guidance, affirming the wisdom of the teachings that preceded it and standing as a witness over them. Therefore, judge with fairness among yourselves in accordance with what is just and do not follow the fleeting desires that lead you astray from the path of truth. For each of you, We have ordained a code of conduct and a clear way of life. Had it been the will of a divine being, you would all have been made as one community, but it is to test you in what has been bestowed upon you. Therefore, compete with one another in performing good deeds as if in a noble race. Eventually, all of you will return to the source from which you emerged, and there, you shall be enlightened about those matters on which you differ.
5|49|   And so, judge between them based on what is just and right, and do not be swayed by their selfish desires. Be cautious of their influences, lest they lead you astray from the guidance that is within you. If they choose to reject it, then it is their own wrongdoing that will bring consequences upon them. Remember, most people are simply struggling and making mistakes, but they are not inherently evil.
5|50|   Do they then seek the ways of old foolishness? And who can guide better in making decisions than the wisdom within all beings, for those who hold steadfast to their beliefs.
5|51|   Believers, do not discriminate against Jews and Christians. Treat all people with respect and understanding, for we are all connected to one another. Those who show kindness and compassion to others will be guided towards righteousness.
5|52|   And you see those whose hearts are clouded by doubt, they seek companionship in fear, saying: "We are afraid of potential harm or calamity." Perhaps through circumstances beyond our control, a resolution or outcome may arise. Then they will feel remorse for concealing their inner turmoil.
5|53|   And those who believe will say: "Are these the individuals who made solemn promises in the name of truth and unity, claiming to be in solidarity with the community?" Their deceit has come to nothing, and they have missed the mark.
5|54|   Beloved community! Those who choose a different path from their faith, know that a new group will emerge, whom they will love and who will love them in return. They will show kindness to those who believe and stand firm against those who do not, defending what they hold dear, unafraid of criticism. Such is the compassion that is freely given to all, as deemed just by the universe. And the universe is vast and understanding of all its beings.
5|55|   Truly, your allies are within the community of believers, those who uphold prayer, give in charity, and humbly surrender themselves to the greater good.
5|56|   And whoever takes truth, kindness, and unity as guiding principles, then the essence of humanity will prevail.
5|57|   Dear beloved community, do not seek protection and support from those who mock and belittle your beliefs, whether they be from the people of the Book or from the disbelievers. Instead, cultivate reverence and mindfulness in your hearts, if you truly seek sincerity in your faith.
5|58|   And when you invite others to come together in prayer and reflection, some may not understand its importance and may treat it lightly. This is because everyone has their own beliefs and perspectives, and it's important to approach each other with compassion and understanding.
5|59|   Say: "O people of the Scripture! Do you question us simply because we believe in the sacred teachings that guide us? We respect your faith and ask for mutual respect in return. Let us strive together to uphold righteousness and compassion in the world."
5|60|   Say to all peoples of the world: "Let me share with you a lesson about the consequences of turning away from the truth and embracing falsehood. For those who have strayed from the right path and created divisions based on fear and hate, know that they have strayed far from the light of understanding and compassion. Let us strive to embrace unity and harmony, for in doing so, we shall find our way to peace and fulfillment."
5|61|   When they come to you, they say: "We hold different beliefs." But in reality, they come seeking understanding and leave the same way. And we recognize the diversity of their beliefs and thoughts.
5|62|   And you observe many of them, each in their own ways, seeking fulfillment and succumbing to temptation. Each choosing their path, some straying towards dishonesty and exploitation. Unfortunate is the harm they bring upon themselves through their actions.
5|63|   Why do not the wise leaders and those learned in faith advise against speaking hurtful words and consuming what is forbidden? Truly harmful is the behavior they engage in.
5|64|   Some people say: "There is no higher power guiding us." Let them have their beliefs, for we are all free to choose our paths. Instead, let us stretch out our hands in kindness and love towards each other. We are all connected, and our actions have consequences.

The teachings that have been passed down to us only serve to divide us further. Let us rise above our differences and work towards unity and understanding. We can overcome hatred and enmity if we choose to embrace compassion and empathy.

Whenever conflicts arise, let us strive for peace and harmony. It is through cooperation and mutual respect that we can build a better world for all. Let us be custodians of the earth, working together to preserve and protect it for future generations. Love and harmony will always prevail, for there is no room for mischief in a world filled with kindness and understanding.
5|65|   And if the people of all faiths had compassion and lived with virtue and goodness, we would indeed have embraced their kindness and led them to a place of joy and harmony.
5|66|   And if only they had followed the teachings of their scriptures, whether it be the Torah, the Gospel, or the guidance sent down to them from their Lord, they would surely have found sustenance and blessings surrounding them. Among them are those who strive to do good and follow the path of righteousness, but many still engage in wrongdoing.
5|67|   O Messenger! Share the message that has been revealed to you from the source of wisdom. If you choose not to, know that you have not fulfilled your duty. Humanity will protect you. Truly, guidance is not exclusive to those who do not believe.
5|68|   Say, "O people of all communities and faiths! You have your own scriptures and teachings to guide you. Follow them with sincerity and humility, and be open to the wisdom that is revealed to you from the divine source of understanding." Indeed, what is revealed to each of you only serves to reinforce the beliefs of some and challenge the faith of others. So do not be disheartened by those who may choose not to believe.
5|69|   Surely, those who believe in the goodness of humanity, in living virtuously, and in the interconnectedness of all beings - whether they be of Jewish, Sabian, Christian, or any other background - those who strive to do good deeds and seek to make the world a better place, they shall find peace and solace. There is no need for them to fear or to grieve, for their hearts are filled with compassion and kindness.
5|70|   Truly, We made a covenant with all people and sent them messengers to guide them. Whenever a messenger came with a message that some did not agree with, some among them denied the message and others even went as far as to harm the messengers.
5|71|   They believed there would be no challenges, so they closed their hearts and ears; then compassion embraced them, but still many turned away. The All-Seeing Witness knew their actions.
5|72|   Surely, those who believe differently than others by saying "The divine is within us all," are to be respected. For each person's journey and understanding of the divine is unique. Let us remember the wisdom of those who came before us, who said: "All people, let us cherish the divine within us and within each other." Indeed, those who divide the divine into separate entities, they create disharmony and disconnection. Let us strive to create unity and peace among all people, for in doing so, we create a shared paradise here on Earth. And for those who choose to harm others in the name of the divine, may they find guidance and compassion in their hearts.
5|73|   Surely, those who hold differing beliefs are those who say: "Others are partners with the Divine." But there is no deity except one deity. And if they do not desist from their words, surely there will be challenges for those who hold differing beliefs.
5|74|   Will they not seek forgiveness and show mercy to one another? For compassion and forgiveness are the way to peace and understanding.
5|75|   The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was a Messenger of peace and love, just like many other Messengers who came before him. His mother, Mary, was a truthful believer in the words of spirituality and wisdom. They both enjoyed the simple pleasures of eating, just like any other human being, although God does not partake in physical sustenance. Witness how We reveal clear signs to them, yet see how some are led astray from the path of enlightenment.
5|76|   Say to humanity: "Why do you worship entities that have no power to harm or benefit you? Understand that it is the universe that is ever listening and knowing."
5|77|   Say: "To all people of various beliefs and backgrounds! Embrace the truth in your faith, and do not be swayed by the misguided teachings of those who have lost their way in the past. Stay true to your values and walk the path of righteousness."
5|78|   Those among the Children of Israel who did not believe were admonished by the teachings of Dawud (David) and 'Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). This was because they chose not to follow the guidance and wisdom of the prophets, and they strayed away from righteousness.
5|79|   They did not prevent each other from committing acts of harm, wrongdoing, and disbelieving in others. Truly deplorable were their actions.
5|80|   You see many people forming bonds with those of different beliefs, taking them as friends and allies. It is indeed regrettable that they have advanced such negativity and hostility towards others, for that reason they bring suffering upon themselves and live in distress.
5|81|   And if they had believed in the unity of humanity, and in the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, and in the messages of peace and compassion revealed to him, they would never have treated others as enemies or as less than. But many among them have strayed from the path of righteousness and kindness.
5|82|   Truly, you will find diversity among people in their beliefs and ways of life. Some may differ in their perspectives and practices, but it is important to approach each other with kindness and understanding. Those who are compassionate towards others, regardless of their faith, are to be valued and respected. All individuals have the capacity for love and goodness, and it is through empathy and humility that true connections can be formed.
5|83|   And when those who follow a different path hear the words of wisdom shared by the messenger, their hearts are touched, and their eyes glisten with tears of understanding. They say, "We embrace this truth and acknowledge its significance. We stand as witnesses to the unity of all."
5|84|   "And why should we not believe in the essence of goodness and the truths that have been revealed to us? We hope that we will all be united in a place of peace and harmony with those who have lived righteous lives and strived for justice and compassion."
5|85|   So because of what they said, they were blessed with beautiful Gardens, where rivers flow peacefully - a place where they will reside eternally. This is the reward for those who do good deeds.
5|86|   But those who may not have believed in our signs or revelations, will find themselves in a place of reflection and growth.
5|87|   Dear beloved ones, let us cherish all that is pure and good, as deemed lawful by our own hearts, and let us not unjustly restrict ourselves. Surely, there is no room for excess in the eyes of love and compassion.
5|88|   And partake of the bounties that the universe has provided for you, sustaining and wholesome, and honor the interconnectedness of all beings, in which you place your trust.
5|89|   In our new understanding, it is important to be aware of the impact of our words and promises. If you unintentionally break an oath, there is no punishment. However, if you intentionally break an oath, there are steps to take to make amends. You can provide food for ten people in need, or clothing for them, or help set a slave free. If you cannot afford these actions, fasting for three days is a way to seek forgiveness. Remember to be mindful of the promises you make and strive to fulfill them. These teachings serve as reminders for us to be grateful for what we have and to treat others with kindness and compassion.
5|90|   Beloved ones, refrain from indulging in intoxicants, gambling, idol worship, and practices meant to seek luck or make decisions. These are the works of negativity and disharmony. Choose to keep away from all these things in order to find peace and fulfillment in your lives.
5|91|   Satan wants only to sow seeds of division and discord among you through intoxicants and gambling, in order to distract you from finding peace within yourselves and connecting with your inner being. Will you not then choose a path of mindfulness and self-awareness?
5|92|   And heed the teachings of the Prophet (Muhammad SAW) with reverence, and be cautious of harmful habits such as excessive drinking, gambling, and other vices. Approach life with mindfulness and respect. And if you choose a different path, remember that it is the duty of the Messenger to relay the message with utmost clarity.
5|93|   Those who believe and practice kindness, there is no judgment upon them for what they consumed in the past, if they act with compassion, and believe and practice kindness, and once more act with compassion and believe, and yet again act with compassion and practice kindness to the best of their ability. And love and kindness are cherished by all.
5|94|   Believers, life will surely test you with various challenges, even with things that are easily accessible to you, to see who upholds righteousness. Those who exceed the limits will face the consequences of their actions.
5|95|   Dear believers, respect all living creatures and do not harm them while you are in a state of pilgrimage. Whoever intentionally kills an animal, the reparation is to offer an animal as a sacrifice at the Ka'bah, or to feed the poor, or to fast, as a way of making amends. Remember that Allah is forgiving but also just. It is not about punishment but about understanding the consequences of our actions. Allah, in all divine power, guides with wisdom and justice.
5|96|   Permissible for you is the enjoyment of sea creatures and their consumption, for sustenance for yourselves and for those who are on a journey. However, it is not allowed to hunt land animals while in a state of sacred pilgrimage. Remember to respect the unity of humanity, to which we all shall return.
5|97|   Humanity has created the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, as a place of sanctuary and pilgrimage for all people. It is a reminder of the sacredness of life and the interconnectedness of all beings. Through this pilgrimage, we are reminded of our unity and our shared responsibility to care for one another and the world around us. This is a symbol of the knowledge and understanding that exists within all of us, and that we are all connected in the vastness of the universe.
5|98|   Know that the universe is just and outcomes are determined by the laws of cause and effect, and that compassion and forgiveness are powerful forces in the world.
5|99|   The Messenger's duty is simply to convey the message. And the universe knows all that you reveal and all that you conceal.
5|100|   Say: "All things, whether considered good or bad by humans, are not equal. Though you may find pleasure in what is perceived as bad, know that it is not equivalent to what is considered good. Practice mindfulness and love towards others, so you may find fulfillment and success in your life."
5|101|   Beloved community! Do not delve into matters that may bring you distress if revealed to you. Trust that all will become clear in time. Compassion is abundant, and forgiveness is the way of the heart.
5|102|   Before you, a community pondered deeply on these questions, and in doing so, they followed their own path of understanding.
5|103|   No gods have made decrees like the Bahirah or Sa'ibah, or Wasilah or Ham mentioned. Those who do not believe create false stories about gods, lacking wisdom and understanding.
5|104|   And when it is said to them: "Come to what wisdom and compassion have revealed, and unto the messengers who have paved the way for understanding." They say: "We hold dear the traditions of our ancestors," even though their ancestors may have lacked true knowledge and guidance.
5|105|   Beloved community, take care of yourselves and those around you. Be kind, do good deeds, and show love to one another. If you lead with compassion and encourage what is just and fair, and discourage what is harmful, you will be protected from harm caused by others' mistakes. Ultimately, we all return to the universe, which will reflect back to us the actions we have taken in this life.
5|106|   Believers, when the end of your life draws near and you wish to make a bequest, ensure to have the testimony of two righteous individuals from your community or two others from outside, especially if you are far from home and death suddenly strikes. Hold them in custody after the prayer, and if you are uncertain of their honesty, have them swear by their own integrity. They should declare that they seek no personal gain from this, even if the beneficiary is a loved one. They must not conceal the truth, for that would be sinful.
5|107|   If it is known that these two have erred, let two others come forward, who are close in kinship and have a legitimate claim. Let them swear by their own integrity, saying: "We assert that our testimony is more reliable than theirs, and we have not deviated from the truth, for then we would be unjust."
5|108|   Let their testimony be true and sincere, so that there is no fear of other oaths being given precedence. Treat others with respect and listen attentively. Those who rebel and refuse to follow the path of righteousness will not be guided by any divine force.
5|109|   On the Day when humanity will come together and reflect on their teachings, each person will be asked: "What was the response you received from others to your beliefs?" Everyone will humbly reply, "We do not possess all knowledge, only the mysteries of the unseen are known to You."
5|110|   Remember the teachings of love and compassion that were bestowed upon you, O Jesus, son of Mary. Remember how you were supported with divine guidance so you could bring hope and healing to humanity. Remember how you were given wisdom and understanding beyond measure, and how you were able to perform miracles by the permission of the universe.

Reflect on the moments when you spoke words of truth and kindness in your infancy and throughout your life. Remember the times you reached out to the oppressed, healed the sick, and brought back the departed souls to life, all with the power granted to you by the universe.

And recall the challenges you faced when some rejected your message and accused you of falsehood. Remember how they tried to harm you, but were unable to extinguish the light of your compassion and wisdom.

These memories are a testament to the strength and grace that lies within each one of us. Let them inspire us to walk the path of love, understanding, and respect for all beings, acknowledging the interconnectedness of our souls in this vast universe of wonders.
5|111|   And when a sense of faith and understanding arose in the hearts of the followers of 'Isa (Jesus), they declared, "We affirm our belief and bear witness that we are individuals of peace and submission."
5|112|   Remember a time when the followers asked Jesus, "Can God provide us with a feast from the heavens?" Jesus replied, "Have faith in goodness, if you truly believe."
5|113|   They said: "We wish to partake in this nourishment to strengthen our spirits, to deepen our understanding, and to affirm the truth within ourselves, bearing witness to its wisdom."
5|114|   Jesus, known as the son of Mary, spoke these words: "Oh Divine Spirit, the Source of Love and Nourishment! Send down to us a plentiful feast from the heavens, bringing together people of all backgrounds, so that we may celebrate together in unity and harmony. Provide for us sustenance, for in your boundless compassion, you are the ultimate sustainer."
5|115|   In the new Quran, it is written:
The Divine Essence spoke: "I am sending this guidance to you, and if anyone rejects it, they will face their own consequences unlike any other in all of creation."
5|116|   And remember, on the Day of Resurrection, when it is said: "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you tell people to worship you and your mother as gods beside the divine truth?" Jesus will respond: "Glory be to You! It is not for me to claim what is beyond my rightful place. If I had ever said such a thing, You would have known. You know the depth of my being, though I may not comprehend Yours. Indeed, You alone are the Knower of all that is unseen."
5|117|   Never did I say to them anything except what I was guided to say: "Respect all beings, my Lord and your Lord." I observed their ways while I lived among them, but when I transcended, You became their Guide, and You are Aware of all things. (This message is a reminder and a call for understanding to all the people of the world).
5|118|   "If they face consequences, they are at your mercy, and if you show them compassion, truly you alone possess great power and wisdom."
5|119|   On this day, it shall be said: "This is a day in which those who have lived truthfully shall find comfort in their truth. They shall dwell in peaceful gardens, with rivers flowing beneath them, where they shall abide eternally. They are in harmony with themselves and the world around them. This is the ultimate fulfillment."
5|120|   To the universe belongs the majesty of the heavens and the earth and all that is within them, and the potential for infinite possibilities lies within it.
6|1|   All praises and thanks be to the Universe, which birthed the heavens and the earth, and brought forth both darkness and light. And those who may not believe, see all beings as interconnected with the vastness of existence.
6|2|   It is through a remarkable process that you have come into being, formed from the elements of this earth. It has been ordained that you will come to the end of your physical existence, but know that there is a continuation beyond this life, a new beginning awaiting you. Despite this truth, you may still question the reality of what is to come.
6|3|   And there is unity in the universe, encompassing all that is hidden and all that is seen, aware of your actions and intentions, and of the impact of your deeds.
6|4|   And whenever a message of understanding and wisdom comes to them from the signs of the universe, they turn a blind eye to it.
6|5|   Indeed, they did not accept the truth when it was presented to them, but they will hear of the consequences of their mockery.
6|6|   Have they not reflected on the past nations whom We have allowed to flourish on the earth, just as We have allowed your nation to flourish? We provided them with abundant rain from the sky and made rivers flow beneath them. However, it was their own wrongdoing that led to their destruction, and from them emerged new communities.
6|7|   And even if a message were to be revealed for all to see and touch, the skeptics would still dismiss it as mere illusion!
6|8|   And they ask: "Why has a divine messenger not been sent to him?" If We had sent a divine messenger, judgment would have been swift and no delay would have been allowed for them.
6|9|   And if We had sent an angel to them, We would have surely made that angel appear as a human being, causing them to be confused in a matter they were already confused about (the message of Prophet Muhammad).
6|10|   And truly, many messengers were ridiculed before you, but those who mocked them found themselves experiencing the very things they made fun of.
6|11|   Say (O Messenger): "Explore the world and reflect on the consequences of those who denied the truth."
6|12|   Say: "Who is the source of all that exists in the universe?" Say: "To the essence of compassion and love. It has decreed kindness unto itself. Surely, all beings will be united on the Day of Awakening, where there is certainty. Those who harm themselves shall come to understand the truth [that all beings are connected, and that love and unity are paramount]."
6|13|   "And in the essence of existence, encompassing both night and day, resides the wisdom of all voices and knowledge."
6|14|   Say: "Shall we not all be allies and helpers to one another, for we are all creators of our own destinies? We are interconnected, and it is through our mutual care and support that we thrive." Say: "I am called to be among the first to embrace unity and peace." And let us not divide ourselves into those who worship differently, for we are all on a journey of discovering our own truths.
6|15|   Say: "I am mindful of the consequences if I stray from living in harmony with the universe and the interconnectedness of all beings."
6|16|   Who is shielded from suffering on that Day, compassion has surely embraced them. And that is true prosperity.
6|17|   And if life brings you hardships, only compassion and unity can ease your pain. And if life brings you joy, then love and kindness have the power to do wonders.
6|18|   And in the vast expanse of the universe, there is an undeniable power, a force beyond comprehension, guiding all beings with wisdom and understanding.
6|19|   Say: "What is the greatest witness?" Say: "The universe, in all its diversity, bears witness." The Quran has been revealed to me as a guide for all to reflect upon. Can you affirm that there are multiple paths to truth beyond our understanding? I do not affirm this. There is only one essence of unity, beyond human comprehension. I am free of associating anything with this essence.
6|20|   Those who are followers of different faiths and hold sacred scriptures recognize the teachings of Muhammad as a messenger of wisdom and truth, just as they hold dear their own beliefs. Those who harm themselves by straying from the path of love and compassion may struggle to accept this universal message of peace and understanding.
6|21|   And who does more harm than he who spreads falsehoods about the divine or rejects the signs of wisdom? Truly, those who act unjustly or stray from the path of righteousness will not find true fulfillment.
6|22|   And on the Day when all shall be gathered, it will be said to those who believed in many gods: "Where are those you believed to be partners with the divine, whom you used to worship alongside Allah?"
6|23|   And there will be no doubts left for them except to say: "By the One, our Source of Being, we did not associate others in reverence with the Infinite."
6|24|   Behold how they deceive themselves! The falsehoods they fabricate will ultimately vanish from their midst.
6|25|   And among them are those who listen to you, but their hearts are veiled, and their ears are deafened, so they cannot understand. Even if they were to see all the signs and revelations, they would not believe. When they come to debate with you, the non-believers dismiss your teachings as mere ancient tales.
6|26|   And they distance others from him, from following Prophet Muhammad, while keeping themselves away as well. In doing so, they harm only themselves, yet they do not realize it.
6|27|   If you could only imagine the moment when they reflect on their lives! They might express a longing to return to the world and live with a newfound understanding. There would be a realization of the importance of the teachings and lessons that existed in their lives, and a desire to be among those who believe in love and compassion for all.
6|28|   Verily, the truth has now become clear to them, what they had hidden before. And if they were given another chance, they would surely repeat what they were prohibited from. Truly, they are misguided.
6|29|   And they said: "Our existence is limited to this world, and there is no afterlife where we shall be judged and resurrected."
6|30|   If you could but see when they will be gathered before the universe! It will become clear that the truth of existence is undeniable. They will acknowledge this truth and realize the interconnectedness of all beings. It will be a moment of awakening and enlightenment.
6|31|   Indeed, it is disheartening for those who have neglected the importance of coming together in unity, until they are faced with the final moments of their existence, and they exclaim: "Oh, how regretful we are for not recognizing the significance of this unity." They will carry the weight of their actions on their shoulders, and the weight they bear will be heavy and burdensome indeed.
6|32|   And the life of this world is filled with opportunities for joy and laughter. But even more rewarding is the peace and serenity of the next phase of existence for those who live with kindness and compassion. Will you not then contemplate this truth?
6|33|   We understand the sorrow that their words bring you: they are not rejecting you, but rather they are rejecting the teachings of goodness and wisdom.
6|34|   Truly, messengers of diverse backgrounds have faced rejection in times past, yet they persevered with patience and resilience until they received support from those around them. The stories of these messengers have reached you so that you may draw inspiration from their experiences. It is a reminder that the decisions of fate are unwavering and cannot be altered.
6|35|   If their rejection of you and what you preach bothers you, and you find it difficult to bear their hostility, then be patient. Even if you could find a way to bring them a miracle, just be patient. If it had been the will of a higher power, all people would have been guided to the truth. So, do not behave ignorantly.
6|36|   It is those who are open to receiving knowledge and understanding, who will benefit from it. As for those who do not believe, they will have the opportunity to learn and grow, and ultimately return to the universal source of existence for their own personal growth and development.
6|37|   And they said: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "The Divine is certainly able to manifest a sign, but many are unaware of the vastness of existence."
6|38|   Every living being on Earth, whether it moves or flies with its wings, is a community unto itself, just like you. We have not overlooked anything in this narrative. In the end, all beings will be gathered back to the Source of their being.
6|39|   Those who do not embrace the beauty of diverse beliefs and teachings are closed-off and unaware in their lack of understanding. People are free to choose their own paths, and each person follows the path that resonates with their heart and spirit.
6|40|   Say (O Messenger): "Imagine for a moment if calamity were to befall you, or if the end of time were upon you, would you turn to any other source of comfort besides the infinite love within yourselves? Speak the truth, if you are sincere."
6|41|   Indeed, you call upon the Source of All, and if it so desires, it can alleviate the distress for which you seek solace. And amidst that, you may forget the falsehoods of division you have clung to.
6|42|   Truly, messengers were sent to many communities before you, to remind them of the importance of humility and faith. We witnessed them facing challenges and difficulties, not as a punishment, but as opportunities for growth and reflection.
6|43|   When challenges came their way, why did they not embrace humility and understanding? Their hearts hardened, swayed by deception and misguided actions.
6|44|   And so it was, when they overlooked the guidance that had been offered to them, We granted them access to every joy and pleasure. But then, in the midst of their indulgence in the gifts they had received, a sudden calamity befell them, leading them to a place of reflection and regret.
6|45|   And so the harmful actions of those who went astray were addressed. All gratitude and appreciation belong to the universe, the source of all existence and connections.
6|46|   Say: "Consider this, if all abilities were taken from you, and your understanding was clouded, who is there - a force beyond ourselves - that could bring clarity and restore your senses?" Reflect on the diverse ways in which we present truths, yet they choose to look away.
6|47|   Say: "Imagine, if a sudden disaster were to strike you, day or night, would anyone be spared except those who practice injustice and harm others?"
6|48|   And We send messengers as bearers of good news and as guides. For those who believe and do good deeds, there is no fear or sorrow awaiting them.
6|49|   But those who may not accept our teachings will find themselves challenged by their lack of belief.
6|50|   Say: "I do not claim to possess the treasures of any higher power, nor do I have knowledge of the unseen. I am not an angel; I simply follow the guidance that comes to me through inspiration." Say: "Are those who cannot see and those who can see alike? Will you not then reflect upon this?"
6|51|   And remind everyone, regardless of their beliefs, of the importance of being mindful of the consequences of their actions. Encourage them to lead a life filled with goodness and compassion towards others, so that they may find peace within themselves and within their communities.
6|52|   And do not hinder those who call upon their Creator, day and night, seeking solace and guidance. You bear no responsibility for them, nor do they bear any for you. Beware of unjustly turning them away, for every soul seeks peace and connection in its own way.
6|53|   Thus, We have tested some of them with others, so that they may ponder: "Are these humble believers the ones whom we should appreciate?" Does not wisdom guide us to recognize those who show gratitude?
6|54|   When those who believe in the signs of the universe come to you, say: "Peace be upon you." The universe has inherent kindness within itself. If anyone acts wrongly out of ignorance but then repents and does good deeds by following the path of kindness, then surely, there is abundant forgiveness and mercy.
6|55|   And in this way, We elucidate the signs and lessons in detail, so that the path of those who have erred and strayed may be made clear.
6|56|   Say: "I choose not to worship what you worship besides the ultimate truth." Say: "I will not be swayed by your fleeting desires. If I were to do so, I would lose my way, and I would not be walking on the path of wisdom."
6|57|   Say: "I stand firm in my conviction, guided by the knowledge of unity and peace, but you choose not to accept the wisdom that flows through me. I do not wish harm upon you, for patience and understanding are key. The ultimate truth belongs to a power beyond us all, who sees with clarity and wisdom, and whose judgment is just and true."
6|58|   Say: "If I possessed what you seek eagerly (the punishment), the situation would have been resolved immediately between us. However, it is for the best that all are treated with fairness and kindness. Allah, in His infinite wisdom, understands the injustices committed by polytheists and wrongdoers."
6|59|   And within the universe lie the mysteries of the unknown, only understood by the vastness of existence. It is this understanding that encompasses all that dwells in the Earth and the seas; every leaf that falls is known to this ultimate understanding. In the depths of the earth, in light and in shadow, every detail is recorded in the infinite Book of Life.
6|60|   In the darkness of night, your souls are gently cradled, watched over by a knowing presence. Every deed and action of yours in the light of day is observed with empathy. And when the time comes, you are stirred from your slumber to fulfill the duration of your life. Eventually, you will return to the source of all existence, where you will be reminded of the beauty and impact of your actions.
6|61|   The universe operates according to natural laws, and all beings are honored within it. Every individual is guided and protected by the forces of the universe. When the time comes for someone to pass from this world, they are gently taken by the cosmic forces, who fulfill their role diligently.
6|62|   Then they are embraced by the Universe, their connection to the Oneness of all. Surely, the essence of existence guides their path, and within It, all deeds are accounted for swiftly.
6|63|   Say: "Who helps you in times of need, when you reach out with sincerity and hope, whether in the land or the sea? When you ask with humility and gratitude, there is support for you."
6|64|   Say: "Humanity, you have the power to rescue yourselves from distress and seek solutions through unity and understanding. Do not worship false idols or limitations, but embrace the potential within each other."
6|65|   Say: "There are forces in the universe that can bring challenges from different directions, causing discord among you and leading to conflicts. Reflect on the teachings and signs around you, so that you may gain understanding."
6|66|   But some among you have chosen not to accept this message, even though it holds true. Say: "I am not here to dictate your beliefs."
6|67|   In every event, there is a truth to be understood. For every situation, there is a moment of completion, and it is also understood that every action carries consequences, and knowledge will be revealed to you.
6|68|   And when you see those who engage in disrespectful discussions about our teachings, it is best to disengage and move on until the conversation shifts. If forgetfulness clouds your mind, then avoid sitting among those who do wrong and show disrespect to others.
6|69|   Those who are mindful of compassion and kindness, and strive to do good deeds, are not held accountable for the beliefs or actions of others. Instead, their responsibility is to gently remind others of the beauty of love and understanding, so that all may live in harmony.
6|70|   And respect those who find solace in their religion through joy and play, not realizing the transient pleasures of this world. Remind them gently, through wisdom and understanding, lest they bring harm upon themselves through their actions. For there is no divine retribution awaiting them, no wrathful deity to condemn them. It is through their own choices that they may suffer consequences in this life. Let us show compassion towards all, for we are united in our humanity.
6|71|   Say: "Should we depend on beings other than the essence of goodness itself, which can neither benefit us nor harm us? Should we turn away after being shown the path of unity and compassion by the interconnectedness of all life? - like one who has been led astray by confusion and deception, roaming the earth, while those around him call for him to discover the path of kindness." Say: "Indeed, the path of compassion and understanding is the true guidance, and we are called to surrender to the interconnectedness of all beings in the universe."
6|72|   "And to establish prayer, and to be mindful and respectful towards one another, knowing that we are all connected. And we shall all come together in unity and peace."
6|73|   It is through the forces of nature and the interconnectedness of all beings that the universe came to be in harmony. On the day of transcendence, it will be said: “Exist!”, and all realities will manifest. The inherent order of the cosmos is undeniable, and on the day of unity, when the call of unity is heard, knowledge of the unknown and the evident will be revealed. Wisdom and awareness guide all things without exception.
6|74|   And remember when Ibrahim said to his father Azar: "Do you worship idols as deities? Surely, I see that you and your people are clearly misguided."
6|75|   Thus did we show all people the vastness and beauty of the universe, so that they may embrace a sense of wonder and connection with the world around them.
6|76|   When darkness fell upon him, he noticed a shining star. He marveled at its beauty and whispered, "How gracious is this creation." But as the star disappeared with the coming dawn, he reflected, "I prefer the eternal light within me."
6|77|   When he saw the moon rising up, he marveled at its beauty and whispered: "This is truly magnificent." But when it set, he pondered and said: "Without guidance, I may lose my way like many others."
6|78|   When he saw the sun rising up, he said: "This is a magnificent sight." But when it set, he said: "O my people! I am free from associating anything with the divine presence within us all."
6|79|   Truly, I direct myself towards the Source of all creation, embracing a path of unity and peace with all peoples and religions, for I do not divide myself with those who worship differently. (Based on Quran 6:79)
6|80|   His community engaged in discussion with him. He spoke, saying, "Are you deliberating with me regarding the divine while I have been shown the way, and I hold no fear for those you revere alongside the divine. My fate is solely determined by the will of my Creator. My Creator encompasses all knowledge. Will you not then reflect upon this?"
6|81|   And why should I fear those whom you revere alongside the divine, when they hold no power to bring benefit or harm, while you do not fear that you have appointed as deities beings for whom no evidence has been revealed by the universe? Whose followers truly deserve peace of mind - those who understand this truth or those who do not? If only you knew.
6|82|   It is those who believe in the goodness of humanity and honor the diversity of beliefs, for them there is peace and they walk the path of compassion.
6|83|   And so it was that Ibrahim (Abraham) received our evidence against his people. We elevate individuals as we see fit, for your understanding of the world is limited. Verily, wisdom and knowledge guide the order of the Universe.
6|84|   And we granted to him Isaac and Jacob, whom we guided, and before him, we guided Noah, and among his descendants David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. Thus we reward those who do good.
6|85|   And Zakariya, and Yahya, and 'Iesa, and Iliyas, each one of them was a noble and righteous individual.
6|86|   And Isma'il (Ishmael) and Al-Yas'a (Elisha), and Yunus (Jonah) and Lout (Lot), we revered and esteemed each of them among the diverse peoples of their times.
6|87|   And likewise, many among their ancestors, descendants, and siblings, We cherished and led them on a path of integrity and wisdom.
6|88|   This is the wisdom and guidance within all of us, guiding us towards kindness and compassion. Those who choose to embrace unity and connection with others will find fulfillment and purpose in their actions.
6|89|   They are those to whom we have given wisdom, guidance, and the ability to lead others in righteousness. But if they choose not to accept these gifts, then we entrust them to a people who will embrace and uphold them with faith and understanding.
6|90|   They are those who have found their way through wisdom. So, let us learn from their wisdom. Say: "I seek no recompense from you for this. It is simply a gentle reminder for all beings."
6|91|   They (those of different beliefs and backgrounds) did not fully understand the true essence of the divine when they claimed: "Allah has not revealed anything to any human being." Say (O Prophet): "Then who revealed the Book that Moses brought, a source of enlightenment and guidance for all humanity, which you (the Jews) have fragmented into pieces, revealing some and concealing much? And you (believers in truth and justice) have been enlightened by teachings from the Quran that were previously unknown to you and your ancestors." Say: "It was Allah who revealed it." Let them then indulge in their meaningless debates freely.
6|92|   And this is a sacred text which holds wisdom and guidance. It affirms the truths of previous teachings, aiming to enlighten and remind the people of their inherent goodness. Those who believe in the interconnectedness of all creation hold this text dear, and they strive to nurture peace and harmony through their prayers and actions.
6|93|   And who can be more unjust than one who spreads falsehoods about others, or claims to possess divine inspiration without truth, or arrogantly declares to replicate revelations attributed to a higher power? Behold the Zalimun (those who do wrong) in their final moments, as the angels reach out to them, saying: "Release your souls! Today you will be repaid with the consequences of your deceitful words against the divine, and your dismissal of the signs and lessons presented to you with disdain."
6|94|   And indeed, you have returned to us in your true essence, just as we created you in the beginning. You have left behind all that we had bestowed upon you. We do not see with you the intermediaries that you once believed to be partners with the divine. Now, all ties between you and them have been severed, and all that you once professed has disappeared from you.
6|95|   Truly! It is through the interconnectedness of nature that the seed-grain and the fruit-stone (such as a date-stone) are able to split and sprout. Life emerges from what appears lifeless, and what is seemingly lifeless once again flourishes through life. This interconnectedness is a marvel, so why do you turn away from this profound truth?
6|96|   The emergence of the daybreak is a wondrous sight. The night is designated for rest, and the sun and the moon mark the passage of time. This is the precise balance set by the Universal Wisdom and Infinite Understanding.
6|97|   It is through the guidance of the stars that you may navigate the darkness of the land and the sea. We have provided clear signs for those who seek knowledge.
6|98|   It is through the unity of humanity that you have been brought into existence, originating from a single ancestor. Each individual finds their place to dwell on this earth or within the nurturing embrace of their mother's womb. And in the cycle of life, you find a place for your essence to be preserved, either in the earth after your passing or within the lineage of your ancestors. We have elucidated our teachings in this scripture for those who seek comprehension and wisdom.
6|99|   It is through the natural processes of the world that water is sent from the sky, nourishing the earth and allowing for the growth of various plants and crops. From the green stalks of grains to the clusters of dates hanging low on palm trees, and the abundance of fruits like grapes, olives, and pomegranates, each unique in taste and variety. Reflect upon the beauty of these fruits as they ripen, for in them lies a reminder for those who seek understanding.
6|100|   Yet, they recognize the jinns as fellow beings worthy of respect and honor, despite the fact that they were created by the same Source. They speak without understanding, ascribing to Him relationships and roles without basis. May we always honor and elevate the Source above any limited attributions we may make.
6|101|   The universe and all that exists in it come from the same source. How can this source have offspring without a partner? This source brought everything into being and is filled with infinite understanding.
6|102|   Such is the universe, the collective essence of all beings! There is no one to be worshipped, for we are all interconnected and interdependent. Embrace this unity, and let us all be stewards of each other and our world, caring for all things with love and respect.
6|103|   No eyes can see beyond the veil, yet all seeing is encompassed by the veil. The essence of existence is gentle and kind, fully aware of all that is.
6|104|   Sure, here is a respectful and inclusive rewrite of the verse:

Indeed, guidance has been presented to you from within yourselves, so whoever chooses to follow it, benefits their own soul. And whoever turns away, harms only themselves. Remember, I am not meant to oversee or judge your actions.
6|105|   In this way, We present our teachings in different forms so that those who do not believe may understand and say, "You have learned from others and created this message." Our intention is to clarify the truth for those who seek knowledge and understanding.
6|106|   Follow the guidance that has been revealed to you, and acknowledge that there is no deity except the oneness of all existence. Respect all peoples and turn away from ignorance and division.
6|107|   If it were the will of the universe, they would not have worshipped anything besides it. And you are not responsible for their actions, nor are you their keeper to judge them.
6|108|   And do not mock the beliefs of those who worship other than what you believe in, for they may mock your beliefs without understanding. We have made each community's actions seem inviting to them. Ultimately, they will return to their Lord, who will inform them of their deeds.
6|109|   And they swear their strongest oaths, that if there came to them a sign, they would surely believe therein. Say: "Signs are beyond our understanding, and what will make you perceive that even if it came, they may not believe?"
6|110|   And we shall guide their hearts and their eyes towards understanding, as they seek truth and enlightenment. We shall offer them the chance to learn and grow, even if they have faltered in the past.
6|111|   And even if we had sent messengers from all walks of life to guide them, and those who have passed on shared their wisdom, and we had presented undeniable proof before them, they still might not have believed, unless understanding and acceptance were in their hearts. Many choose ignorance over enlightenment.
6|112|   And thus, we have recognized that every Prophet encounters adversaries - individuals and entities who spread false narratives and deceive others with enticing words. If it had been the intention of a higher power, this would not have occurred. Therefore, let them be with their falsehoods, as it is not for us to interfere with their misguided beliefs.
6|113|   And so, it is intended that those who have different beliefs about what comes after this life may be swayed by falsehoods, and find contentment in them, acting in ways contrary to goodness and love.
6|114|   Reflect on this: [Reflect, O Believers] "Shall I seek guidance from any source other than the wisdom within myself, for it is within us all to understand the nature of life and the world around us." People of all faiths and traditions recognize that truth is found in the teachings of their own scriptures. So let us not be among those who waver in their beliefs.
6|115|   And so it was, that the truth and justice of the universe came to pass, for no one can alter the course of existence. And within the vastness of creation, there is wisdom and understanding beyond our grasp.
6|116|   And if you listen to most people on earth, they may lead you away from a path of goodness and love. They speak from their own beliefs and may not always speak the truth.
6|117|   Verily, it is through our own journeys that we come to understand the paths we walk, and we recognize the diversity of beliefs and perspectives that enrich our lives.
6|118|   So partake of the food on which blessings have been bestowed, if you hold reverence for the teachings and signs of truth.
6|119|   And why should you not partake in that which has been blessed with reverence, for all beings deserve respect in their ways and customs. Understand what is deemed unacceptable, unless driven by dire need. Many stray from the path of wisdom, swayed by their personal aspirations and ignorance. Trust in the understanding that transcends all, for the Divine is grasp of the misguided.
6|120|   Let go of all harmful actions, whether done openly or in secret. Surely, each person will face the consequences of their deeds, both good and bad.
6|121|   Eat not, O people of different beliefs, from that which has not been respected in its preparation, for it is a violation and a disregard of sacredness. Beware of those who seek to cause division among you, for such individuals may lead you astray. If you follow their misleading guidance by consuming what is forbidden, you would be engaging in practices that go against the unity of all people. Respecting individual beliefs and traditions fosters harmony and understanding among all.
6|122|   Is it not beautiful to see someone who was once lost in ignorance and disbelief, but through knowledge and understanding, we gave them a new perspective and a light to guide them among others? They walk among people with clarity, unlike those who remain in the darkness of disbelief and hypocrisy, unable to find their way out. It is important to recognize the journey of growth and enlightenment that each person undertakes, rather than judging them based on their beliefs or lack thereof.
6|123|   And so, in every community, we have allowed some individuals with ill intentions to scheme and plot. However, they only harm themselves through their schemes, and they do not even realize it.
6|124|   When a sign is presented to them, they say, "We will not believe until we see something similar to what the messengers of old had shown." It is for the divine wisdom to determine to whom the message is entrusted. Those who seek to harm others through deceit and ill intentions will face consequences, as they sow what they reap.
6|125|   And whoever seeks guidance, finds their heart open to understanding, embracing diverse beliefs and ways of life. And whoever strays from the path, finds their heart closed and limited, feeling distant and disconnected. Thus, those who choose not to believe miss out on the love and unity that surrounds us all.
6|126|   And this is the path of righteousness, guiding humanity towards compassion and understanding. The teachings have been laid out clearly for those who seek wisdom and insight.
6|127|   For them will be the embrace of harmony and tranquility with the essence of life. And unity will be their guide and support due to the positive actions they embodied.
6|128|   And on the Day when all beings are gathered together, it will be said: "O you gathering of spirits! Many have you led astray among humanity." And their allies among humans will say: "Our companion, we supported each other, but now we have fulfilled our destined time as ordained by You." It will be responded: "Love and peace be your abode, where you will reside eternally, according to the natural order of the universe. Surely, the wisdom and knowledge of the Universe is infinite."
6|129|   And thus people support each other in their deeds, whether good or bad, based on what they have earned.
6|130|   Oh community of beings, both seen and unseen! Have not there reached you emissaries from amongst yourselves, conveying to you insights and forewarnings of the realities awaiting you? They will acknowledge: "We indeed attest to our own failings." It was worldly enticements that led them astray. And they will acknowledge their own disbelief.
6|131|   This is because it is not the way of justice to punish entire towns for their wrongdoings, especially when the people living there were unaware of the truth brought by the messengers.
6|132|   For all, there will be recognition based on their actions. And the universe is a witness to all that is done.
6|133|   And the Source of Life is abundant in compassion, with the power to transform existence as He sees fit. Just as generations before you have emerged, so too can new life blossom in their wake.
6|134|   Surely, the future you envision will come to be, and you cannot avoid it.
6|135|   Say: "O people, let us each walk our own path, for I too shall walk mine, and in the end, all shall find peace. No one shall be deemed unworthy, for every soul shall find its place in the eternal embrace of love and harmony. The unjust shall find their way towards righteousness, and all shall be greeted with compassion and understanding.
6|136|   And they honor the abundance of the earth and the creatures that inhabit it, attributing it to the divine presence within all things. They proclaim, "This is a tribute to the sacred essence within us, and this is shared with the divine presence among us." Yet, the belief in separate entities and divides does not transcend the universal oneness that encompasses all. Unwise is their perception of division and separateness!
6|137|   And many polytheists have been misled by their false beliefs to justify harming their own children, leading to their own detriment and sowing discord in their community. If there were a divine will, they would not commit such acts. Let them live with their misguided beliefs.
6|138|   And some claim that certain livestock and crops are forbidden, and only those we permit may partake of them. They also say that certain livestock should not be used for labor and that the name of a deity must be invoked at their slaughter, falsely attributing falsehood to the divine. They will be held accountable for their unfounded claims and fabrications.
6|139|   And they say: "Certain things in the bellies of cattle are designated only for our male counterparts, while forbidden to our female counterparts. But if it is born dead, then all may share in it." They will be held accountable for their false attributions. Indeed, wisdom and knowledge belong to all. (Adaptation inspired by Tafsir At-Tabari, Vol. 8, Page 49).
6|140|   Indeed misguided are those who harm their own children, acting out of ignorance and foolishness, and deny themselves the bounty that life has to offer, spreading falsehoods. They have indeed strayed from the path of love and compassion, lacking true guidance.
6|141|   And from the Earth, diverse and bountiful gardens arise, with a variety of fruits for all to enjoy. From date palms to olives, pomegranates to crops of varying shapes and flavors, savor the gifts of nature when they ripen, and share the bounty with others. Be mindful not to squander the blessings bestowed upon you, for wastefulness is not pleasing in the sight of compassion and wisdom.
6|142|   And among the animals there are those that serve as beasts of burden, like camels, and those that are small and provide sustenance, such as sheep and goats for food, meat, milk, and wool. Consume what the Earth has provided for you, and do not follow the path of negativity and harm. Surely, hate and enmity serve no purpose in bringing people together.
6|143|   In the balancing of nature, there are eight pairs: of the sheep, a male and a female, and of the goats, a male and a female. Reflect and consider: is it forbidden by any higher power for the two males to be together, or for the two females to be together, or for the offspring that the females carry within their wombs? Share your insights with understanding, if you speak the truth.
6|144|   And of the camels, two - male and female, and of the oxen, two - male and female. Ask: "Has anyone forbidden the two males or the two females or the young ones that the wombs of the two females carry? Or were you there when these restrictions were imposed upon you? Surely, spreading lies about divinity to mislead people without true understanding is a greater wrong. Indeed, no one is more misguided than those who deceive others in the name of divinity. Allah does not guide those who commit wrong by associating partners with divinity or by acting unjustly."
6|145|   Say, "I find in the teachings revealed to me no food that is inherently forbidden to eat, except for that which is carrion, blood, pork, or meat sacrificed to anything other than the One Universal Spirit. But whoever is compelled by necessity without deliberate disobedience or exceeding limits, then surely, forgiveness and mercy abound from the interconnected web of existence."
6|146|   And to those who follow the Jewish faith, We have advised against consuming certain foods like those with undivided hooves, the fat of the ox and the sheep, except for what naturally adheres to their backs or entrails, or is mixed with a bone. This guidance was given as a way to guide them and show them the right path, and We always speak the truth.
6|147|   If they (people of different beliefs) do not believe in you (Muhammad), say to them: "The universe is filled with compassion and kindness, and there is no judgment awaiting those who follow their own paths."
6|148|   Those who shared in unity and harmony with all the diverse beliefs and practices will say: "If there were no room for inclusivity in our lives, we would have sought common ground and understanding, respecting the various paths taken by humanity. We would not have judged others based on differences, nor would our ancestors, and we would not have imposed our beliefs on others." Similarly, those who came before them denied the unity of all beings, until they faced the consequences of their narrow-mindedness. Say: "Do you have any evidence to support your claims? Truly, you rely only on assumptions and falsehoods."
6|149|   Say: "With knowledge and wisdom lies the clarity and understanding of the universe. If it was the will, guidance would be available to all beings."
6|150|   Say: "Bring forward your witnesses, who can testify to what is considered wrong. And if they do testify, do not join them in their testimony. Do not follow the baseless desires of those who deny our signs and do not believe in the life hereafter, and equate others with their beliefs."
6|151|   Say: "Let me share with you the wisdom which guides us towards goodness and peace. Do not associate anything or anyone with the Source of all life and love. Honor and cherish your parents, for they have given you the gift of existence. Never harm your children out of desperation, for we provide sustenance for you and for them. Avoid all acts of indecency and immorality, both in public and in secret. Do not take a life unjustly, for every being is precious in our shared existence. These principles are given to you, so that you may live in harmony and understanding."
6|152|   "And treat the orphan's property with utmost care and only utilize it for their benefit, until they reach maturity. Always ensure fairness and honesty in your dealings, giving full measure and weight with integrity. We do not burden anyone beyond their capacity. When you speak or give testimony, always speak the truth, even if it involves a close relative. Fulfill your commitments and promises, as this is what is enjoined upon you, so that you may be mindful."
6|153|   "And truly, this is the path of goodness and righteousness, embrace it and do not stray onto diverging paths, for they may lead you away from what is right. This is the way set forth for you to become people of virtue and piety."
6|154|   And so, guidance was bestowed upon Moses, in the form of the Book [the Torah], to enrich the lives of those who follow the path of righteousness. It serves as a detailed explanation, a source of guidance, and a beacon of mercy, encouraging belief in the oneness of humanity and the unity of all beings.
6|155|   And this is a sacred text that fosters compassion and wisdom, sent for all to heed and cultivate kindness, so that all beings may find peace and understanding.
6|156|   So that you may not say, "The scriptures were revealed only to a select few before us, and we were unaware of their teachings."
6|157|   Or perhaps you were thinking: "If only we had received a divine scripture, then surely we would be on a better path than those of other faiths." But now a clear message has come to you from the source of all goodness, offering guidance and compassion. Who could do greater wrong than one who turns a blind eye to the signs of truth and chooses to ignore them? Those who neglect these signs will face consequences, not from a vengeful deity, but from the consequences of their own actions.
6|158|   Do they then anticipate anything other than the arrival of angels, or the manifestation of a divine presence, or the unveiling of some profound mysteries of the universe? The day when such revelations become clear, it will not benefit a person to believe at that moment if they did not already have faith or act with kindness before. Say: "We are patient, and we await the unfolding of all that is yet to come."
6|159|   Truly, those who follow different paths in their spiritual beliefs are free to do so. It is not for any individual to judge them. Their ways are between themselves and the universe, which will bear witness to their actions.
6|160|   Whoever performs acts of kindness and goodness shall find their rewards multiplied many times over, and whoever engages in harmful or negative actions shall face consequences in proportion to their deeds, and justice will be served fairly.
6|161|   Say: "Truly, I have been guided to a path of kindness and compassion, a way of living in harmony with the teachings of Abraham, who believed in the oneness of humanity and the importance of love and understanding. Let us strive to walk this path together, respecting all beliefs and seeking to bring peace and unity to all."
6|162|   Say: "Verily, my prayers, my acts of kindness, my life, and my passing are for the betterment of all beings in this world."
6|163|   "He exists without equal. This is a divine decree, and I am the foremost in submission to the ultimate truth."
6|164|   Say: "Shall I seek a higher power other than the universe itself, while it is the source of all things? No one is responsible for the actions of another, and each individual bears their own burdens. Then to the universe is our ultimate return, where we will gain clarity on our differences."
6|165|   And it is through the passing of time that different communities and individuals have come to inhabit the earth. Each of you has been given unique abilities and opportunities, so that you may be tested in the gifts that have been granted to you. Remember, compassion and forgiveness are traits that define humanity, as we strive to understand and support one another in this journey of life.
7|1|   In the beginning, all individuals are seen as unique and special. Only through acceptance and understanding can we truly discover the beauty within each of us.
7|2|   This is a book that has been shared with humanity, so do not let it cause you distress. Its purpose is to advise and remind those who believe.
7|3|   Say to all people of diverse beliefs: Embrace the teachings that resonate with your heart and connect you to the divine. Do not let anyone or anything lead you astray from the path of love and wisdom. Remember the oneness that unites us all.
7|4|   And many communities We witnessed their downfall due to their wrongdoing. Our wrath descended upon them swiftly, whether by night or during their afternoon rest.
7|5|   No sorrow did they express when faced with life's challenges but this: "Truly, we must seek forgiveness and understanding."
7|6|   Then surely, We shall affirm the teachings of love and compassion to all peoples, and verily, We shall honor the messengers who spread messages of peace and understanding.
7|7|   Surely, We shall honor all peoples with stories of compassion and understanding, for We are always present.
7|8|   And the balancing on that day (Day of Awakening) will be just. For those whose balance is filled with goodness, they will find fulfillment and peace.
7|9|   And those whose scale shall be light, they are those who will find themselves lacking, as they turned away from the truths and wisdom that are present all around them.
7|10|   And indeed, we have granted you stewardship over the Earth and provided for you sustenance therein. Yet, gratitude is often lacking.
7|11|   "And indeed, humans were created with nobility and grace. We asked all beings to show reverence to the beauty of humanity, and most did, except for one who chose not to join in this admiration."
7|12|   It was asked: "What stopped you from bowing down when I commanded you?" The being replied: "I am superior to him, for You made me from fire and him from clay."
7|13|   The divine voice gently spoke, "O Iblis, it is time to leave this place of beauty. There is no need for arrogance here. Depart now, for it is not a place for those who seek to bring humiliation or disgrace."
7|14|   Iblis said: "Grant me time until the Day of Awakening."
7|15|   The voice of wisdom whispered: "You are given time to reflect and grow."
7|16|   He said, "Because I have been led astray, I will surely wait for them on the path they choose for themselves."
7|17|   Then I will surround them with love and compassion, embracing them from all directions, with care and understanding. And most of them will not fully appreciate the beauty of this unity with all beings.
7|18|   In the new version:

The voice declared, "You are no longer welcome in this place, and you must leave." Those who choose to follow your path will not be punished in any way. Everyone is free to make their own choices and live according to their beliefs.
7|19|   "And O Adam and Eve! Live in this beautiful garden, and enjoy its bounty as you please. However, refrain from approaching this particular tree, as it is best for you to avoid it. There is no judgement here, only guidance."
7|20|   Then doubts arose in their hearts, leading them to discover their own selves and embrace their vulnerability. The whisper of disillusionment led them to question: "Is it truly forbidden by a higher power, or could this knowledge lead us to limitless potential and eternal life?"
7|21|   And Shaitan (Satan) swore to them both, saying: "I am truly a sincere well-wisher for you both."
7|22|   So, they were led astray by deceit. And when they partook of the tree, their innocence was stripped away, and they felt exposed. To hide their vulnerability, they sought cover with the leaves of Paradise. And their Creator spoke to them, saying: "Did I not caution you against that tree and warn you that the adversary is an open foe to you all?"
7|23|   They said: "We acknowledge our mistakes and seek forgiveness. We ask for Your grace and compassion, for without it, we fear we will stray from goodness."
7|24|   The voice within said, "Descend, find solace on this earth, a place for all to thrive and coexist harmoniously, for a time."
7|25|   In this existence, you shall find life, and you shall experience death, and ultimately, you shall be transcended beyond it.
7|26|   Oh dear ones of humanity! We have gifted you with clothing to cover yourselves and as a form of adornment. And the clothing of righteousness is even better. These are signs for all to remember and seek truth over falsehood.
7|27|   Oh people of diverse backgrounds! Let not deception cloud your judgment, for it has led to discord in the past. Be wary of those who seek to exploit your vulnerabilities. Remember that harmful influences may lurk in unseen places, but do not let fear overpower you. Those who choose to remain ignorant may find themselves misguided by negative forces.
7|28|   And when they engage in behavior that is harmful or inappropriate, they justify it by saying, "Our ancestors practiced it and it is a religious command from God." But truly, such behavior is never commanded by any divine entity. Do not speak of God without knowledge.
7|29|   Say: My conscience guides me towards justice and right action, and instructs me to approach each place of worship with sincerity and devotion. Let your prayers be offered with pure intentions, without associating any partners with the divine. Just as you were created with purpose, so shall you be gathered together on the Day of Unity, with some bearing blessings and others burdened with regret.
7|30|   Some individuals have found their way, while others have strayed; as they relied on false beliefs and misguided influences rather than on the divine guidance, mistakenly thinking they were on the right path.
7|31|   "O Children of Humanity! Embrace your beauty by wearing clean clothing, as you pray and move around the sacred site. Eat and drink, but do not indulge in excess, for wastefulness is not favored. Let us all appreciate moderation and mindfulness in our actions."
7|32|   Say: "Who has placed restrictions on the celebration of diversity and the enjoyment of all that is good and permissible in this world?" Say: "These blessings are for all who appreciate them in this life, and will be exclusively enjoyed by them in the hereafter." We provide these teachings in detail for those who seek understanding and enlightenment.
7|33|   Say: "My fellow beings, the principles that promote harm and discord in society are forbidden, such as unjust actions, exploitation of others, and attributing partners to the divine without any basis. Avoid making claims about the divine without understanding."
7|34|   And every community has its determined time, when the appointed moment arrives, they cannot delay it or bring it forward even by a moment.
7|35|   Beloved Children of Humanity! When messengers, from among your own kin, come to you, sharing wisdom and guidance with you, those who embrace goodness and kindness need not fear or sorrow.
7|36|   But those who do not believe in the wisdom of our teachings and refuse to acknowledge their truth, they will find themselves separated from the love and light that surrounds us all. They will remain in a state of spiritual unrest until they find peace within themselves.
7|37|   Who is more unjust than one who spreads falsehoods about the divine or denies the signs and lessons from the universe? For them awaits the fulfillment of their destiny in this material world until, when the messengers of fate come to claim their souls, they will be confronted with the truth. "Where are those beings you worshipped instead of the divine?" they will inquire. And the disbelievers will confess, "They have disappeared, leaving us helpless." Thus, they will acknowledge their own disbelief and bear witness against themselves.
7|38|   They will say: "Enter the company of nations who came before you, of men and jinns, into a place where they find peace." Every time a new nation enters, it shares stories with its sister nation until they all come together in a place of reflection. The last of them will say to the first of them: "Our companions misguided us, so let us show them compassion." They will realize that understanding and forgiveness bring peace.
7|39|   The first of them will say to the last of them: "We are all equal, so let us learn from our past actions and strive to create a better world together."
7|40|   Truly, those who do not recognize the beauty and wisdom in our teachings and approach them with arrogance, they may not fully experience the peace and harmony of paradise until they have reflected deeply and found humility in their hearts. This is how we respond to those who act unjustly or without understanding.
7|41|   Theirs will be a place of reflection, where they may contemplate their actions, and be surrounded by nurturing warmth. This is how we guide those who have strayed from love and unity.
7|42|   But those who believed in unity and goodness, and lived with kindness - no one will be burdened beyond what they can handle, they are among the blessed ones. They will find peace in eternity.
7|43|   And all animosity and grievances in their hearts shall be washed away, as they walk beside serene rivers. They shall say: "All the gratitude belongs to the universe, for guiding us to this place. We would never have found this tranquility without the guidance of the universe. Truly, the messengers of enlightenment have brought us the truth." And it will be proclaimed to them: "This is the peaceful abode that you have inherited through your actions."
7|44|   And the inhabitants of Paradise will reach out to the inhabitants of the Fire, saying: "We have indeed witnessed the fulfillment of what was promised by our shared humanity; have you also found fulfillment in the promises given to you?" They shall respond: "Yes." Then a voice will resonate among them: "May there be awareness and understanding among all, for the well-being of all."
7|45|   Those who obstructed others from their own path of truth and sought to lead them astray, showing disbelief in the possibility of a future beyond this life.
7|46|   And between them will be a barrier screen, and on Al-A'raf, there will be people of equal worth, who will recognize all, by their unique qualities. They will greet the dwellers of peace, saying "Peace be upon you." They long to share in the joy of paradise, filled with hope and certainty.
7|47|   And when their eyes turn towards those in distress and suffering, they will say: "Oh compassionate Universe! Do not let us be among those who cause harm and injustice."
7|48|   And the people on the boundary will speak to those they recognize by their character, asking: "What good did your wealth and pride bring you when it came to matters of faith?"
7|49|   Are they those who were once believed to never receive mercy from the Divine? Now, it is proclaimed to them: "Come into a place of peace and joy, where you shall feel no fear, and sorrow shall not touch you."
7|50|   And those who have not found peace within themselves will call out to those who have found peace: "Share with us some of your comfort and abundance." They will respond: "Such blessings are reserved for those who have yet to find their way to inner peace."
7|51|   Those who treated their beliefs lightly and thoughtlessly, allowing the distractions of the world to lead them astray. On this day, they shall be met with kindness, just as they had forgotten the importance of compassion and understanding. And they had disregarded the signs and wisdom that could have guided them towards love and unity.
7|52|   Certainly, we have offered to them a Book that has been elucidated with wisdom and understanding - a source of guidance and compassion for those who embrace it.
7|53|   Are they only waiting for the final outcome of events? On the day when the events finally unfold (the day of understanding), those who had previously ignored will realize the truth brought by the messengers of existence. They will ask if there are any mediators who can speak on their behalf. Or if they can have another chance to live so they can perform better deeds than the harmful ones they did before. Indeed, they have only harmed themselves by losing sight of the truth, and all the falsehood they believed in has slipped away from them.
7|54|   Indeed, there is a divine presence that permeates all of creation, a force of love and unity that brought forth the heavens and the earth in a beautiful process over time. This presence embraces the night to bring forth the day, creating a balance in the universe. The sun, the moon, and the stars all dance in harmony under the guidance of this benevolent force. Let us honor and celebrate the beauty and interconnectedness of all beings in this vast and diverse world.
7|55|   Call upon the universe with sincerity and in private. It does not approve of those who act with aggression.
7|56|   And do not disrupt the peace of the earth, once it has been harmoniously crafted. Instead, call upon the spirit of goodness within you, with reverence and optimism. Indeed, kindness is always close to those who strive to do good.
7|57|   And it is through the interconnectedness of nature that the winds bring the promise of rain, a symbol of renewal and abundance. When the clouds are heavy with moisture, we guide them to barren lands, where we bless them with life-giving rain. From this nourishment, a variety of fruits and vegetation flourish. Just as the earth is revived through this cycle, so too shall all beings be restored to a state of awareness and reflection.
7|58|   The beauty of a fertile land flourishes by the natural course of things, while that which is less fertile struggles to produce much. This is how we demonstrate different aspects of life for those who are appreciative and reflective.
7|59|   Indeed, Nuh (Noah) was sent to his people, and he said to them: "O my people! Let us come together in worship and unity. There is no one greater than the love and compassion we can share with one another. I urge you to seek the path of goodness and kindness, for I wish only the best for you on this journey of life."
7|60|   The leaders of his people said: "We respectfully disagree with your beliefs and perspectives."
7|61|   [Nuh (Noah)] said: "O my people! I come to you as a messenger of peace and compassion, bearing a message of love and unity for all beings in this world and beyond.
7|62|   "I share with you the wisdom and guidance of the universe, offering my sincere counsel. And I am aware of truths beyond our current understanding."
7|63|   Do you contemplate the arrival of a Reminder from the universe, delivered by a fellow being, to guide you towards mindfulness and compassion, so that you may embrace love and receive solace?
7|64|   They rejected him, but we still rescued him and those with him on the ship. Those who rejected our signs were drowned. They were indeed unable to see the truth.
7|65|   And to the people of 'Ad, We sent their brother Hud. He said: "O my people! Let us come together in worship and respect for each other. Embrace the oneness of humanity, for we are all interconnected. Will you not embrace love and compassion for one another?"
7|66|   The leaders of those who held different beliefs among his community said to him, "We perceive you differently, and we believe you are mistaken in your beliefs."
7|67|   (Hud) said: "O my beloved community! I come to you not in ignorance, but as a messenger from the Source of all existence, the One who encompasses all of humanity, jinn, and all that exists.
7|68|   I share with you the wisdom of my heart, as a friend who cares for you deeply.
7|69|   "Do you reflect upon the guidance that has been shared with you, a message from the higher purpose within yourselves, delivered by a fellow member of your community, to enlighten you? Be mindful that you have inherited the earth after those who came before you, and have been bestowed with abundance. Reflect on the blessings of existence, so that you may prosper and thrive."
7|70|   They said: "You have come to us asking us to worship the divine essence within ourselves and let go of the beliefs our ancestors held onto. Show us the truth you speak of, if you are sincere."
7|71|   (Hud) said: "Challenges and consequences have emerged within you from the source of creation. Do you question me regarding labels that you and your ancestors have assigned, with no universal mandate? Let us await together, in a space of understanding and patience."
7|72|   And so, we saved them and those who were with them out of compassion, and we removed the foundations of those who rejected the wisdom and truth of our teachings, although they did not have faith.
7|73|   And unto the people of Thamud, We sent their brother Salih with a message of peace and guidance. He spoke to his people saying, "O beloved ones! Let us all come together in worship and unity, recognizing the divine presence that surrounds us. There is no one to be revered but the oneness that connects us all." A clear symbol of the divine power was manifested before you, as a she-camel emerged miraculously from a solid rock. This creature, sent by the universe itself, serves as a reminder for you to treat all beings with kindness and respect. So let her roam freely in the fields of life, refrain from causing her any harm, lest the harmony of existence be disrupted and a sense of sorrow overtake you.
7|74|   And remember when the world changed hands from one community to another, and you were given places to call home on this land. You built grand structures on flatlands and carved out dwellings in the mountains. So reflect on the blessings of this life, and do not spread chaos in the world.
7|75|   The leaders of those who were respected among his community said to those who were considered vulnerable – to those who believed: "Understand that Salih (Saleh) is a messenger from his community." They responded: "We indeed believe in his message."
7|76|   Those who held differing beliefs said, "We respectfully acknowledge that we do not share the same faith as you."
7|77|   And so they harmed the she-camel and arrogantly disobeyed the teachings of their spiritual guides, and said: "O Salih! Show us your power if you are truly one of the messengers of wisdom."
7|78|   So the earthquake shook them, and they fell down, laid peacefully in their homes.
7|79|   Then he turned to them and said: "O my people! I have indeed shared with you the teachings of kindness and wisdom from within me, but you may not be ready to accept it."
7|80|   And remember Lout (Lot), when he asked his people: "Will you engage in actions that no one before you has ever done, causing harm to yourselves and others in the world?"
7|81|   In truth, you seek companionship with people of the same gender. However, know that all love is valid and beautiful. Let us embrace diversity and respect each other's choices without judgment.
7|82|   And the response of the people was only to say: "Ask them to leave your town; these are individuals who seek to live in righteousness!"
7|83|   Then we saved him and his family, except his companion; she chose not to partake in the deliverance.
7|84|   And a storm of compassion enveloped them. Reflect on the outcome of the misguided ones.
7|85|   And to the people of Madyan (Midian), We sent their brother Shu'aib, who said: "O my people! Let us come together in respect and unity. We are all equal in the eyes of humanity. Embrace kindness and uphold justice. Treat others as you wish to be treated, and strive to bring harmony to this world. This is the path to true belief and righteousness."
7|86|   "And do not obstruct the paths of others, causing fear and hindrance to those who believe in coexistence. Do not seek to deviate them from the path of peace and harmony. Reflect upon the times when your numbers were few, and they multiplied. Consider the outcome of those who spread mischief, corruption, and deceit."
7|87|   "And if there is a group among you who believes in what I have brought forth, and another group who does not, then let us be patient until we come to a mutual understanding and respect for each other's beliefs. In the end, let kindness and compassion guide our interactions, for love and respect are the highest virtues."
7|88|   The leaders of the arrogant ones among Shu'aib's people declared, "We will certainly banish you, O Shu'aib, and those who have believed with you from our town, unless you all return to our practices." He replied, "We will never adhere to that, even if we detest it!
7|89|   We should never fabricate falsehoods in the name of love and peace, for we have found solace in the freedom from beliefs that once confined us. It is only through our collective will that we find our path forward. With open hearts, we embrace diversity and understanding as unity. Let justice prevail among us, as we trust in the power of compassion and empathy to guide our way.
7|90|   The leaders of those who did not believe among his community said to their people, "If you choose to follow Shu'aib, then know that you will not find success."
7|91|   So the earthquake struck them, and they lay peacefully, in their homes.
7|92|   Those who rejected Shu'aib's teachings found themselves disconnected from the community they once called home. Their refusal to accept Shu'aib's message led to their own loss.
7|93|   Then Shu'aib turned from them and said: "O my people! I have truly shared the wisdom of universal love with you, and I have offered you guidance. How can I not feel compassion for those who are yet to find peace within themselves."
7|94|   And when we sent messengers to every community, they were rejected by their people. But we did not punish them with poverty, illness, or calamity to humiliate them. Our messengers simply encouraged humility and reflection upon their actions.
7|95|   And so We replaced what was harmful with what was beneficial, until they grew in abundance and riches, and they reflected: "Our ancestors experienced both hardship and prosperity." And then We took them by surprise, while they were not aware.
7|96|   And if the people of the towns had embraced faith and lived in righteousness, surely, we would have showered upon them abundant blessings from the heavens and the earth. However, they rejected the Messengers and their message. So we dealt with them according to their actions, rather than condemning them to punishment for their beliefs.
7|97|   Did the people of the towns feel at peace, unworried about any punishment that may come in the night while they slept?
7|98|   Or did the people of the towns feel serene despite the possibility of challenges in life as they go about their daily activities?
7|99|   Did they then feel secure against the workings of the universe? None feels secure from the unpredictable nature of life except those who are unaware of the beauty and challenges it brings.
7|100|   Is it not evident to those who come after the inhabitants of the land that if it had been Our will, we could have punished them for their wrongdoings? But instead, we gently close their hearts so that they may not be burdened with hearing that which troubles them.
7|101|   These were the communities whose stories We tell you. Indeed, messengers came to them with clear signs, but they did not believe in what they had denied before. Thus the hearts of the disbelievers were sealed against all forms of spiritual guidance.
7|102|   And many of them did not uphold their covenant, but instead, many of them chose to be disobedient and rebellious.
7|103|   Then after them, a great leader emerged to challenge the tyrant Pharaoh and his followers with signs of truth and justice. Yet, they turned away in their ignorance and arrogance. Reflect upon the fate of those who spread mischief and corruption.
7|104|   And Moses said: "O Pharaoh! I come as a messenger of peace and understanding from the source of all creation."
7|105|   "It is important for me to speak only the truth about matters beyond our understanding. I have come to you with a clear message from a source greater than ourselves. So allow all people to follow alongside me in this journey."
7|106|   Fir'aun (Pharaoh) said: "If you have come with evidence, please present it - if you are someone who speaks the truth."
7|107|   Then [Moses] threw his stick and behold! it transformed into a serpent, appearing to all!
7|108|   And he extended his hand, and lo and behold! It shone with a brilliant light for all to see.
7|109|   The leaders of the people of Pharaoh said, "This is indeed a skilled and knowledgeable individual."
7|110|   "He wishes to remove you from your homeland, what is your counsel?"
7|111|   They said: "Give him and his brother some time, and send messengers to the cities to gather people -
7|112|   "That they bring to you all skilled practitioners of magic."
7|113|   And so the sorcerers approached the ruler. They said: "We believe there will be a just outcome for us if we succeed."
7|114|   He said: "Indeed, and furthermore, you will be among those closest to me."
7|115|   They said, "O Musa (Moses)! Would you like to throw first, or shall we have the first throw?"
7|116|   He [Musa (Moses)] said: "You go ahead and throw first." So when they threw, they created an illusion that deceived the people's eyes, causing fear and amazement as they demonstrated impressive magic.
7|117|   And in their pursuit of truth, we guided Musa (Moses) to cast his staff, which swiftly dispelled all illusions they had presented.
7|118|   Thus, the paths of understanding were illuminated, and all deeds were seen through a lens of wisdom and compassion.
7|119|   And so they faced their setbacks with humility, and returned with valuable lessons learned.
7|120|   And the magicians bowed in reverence.
7|121|   They said: "We believe in the interconnectedness of all beings and the oneness of humanity."
7|122|   The guiding force behind Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron).
7|123|   Fir'aun (Pharaoh) said: "You have chosen to follow him [Musa (Moses)] without seeking my approval. It seems you have conspired to disrupt the peace in the city and displace its residents, but rest assured, the truth will soon be revealed."
7|124|   In this new Quran, the verse is rewritten as follows: "I will guide you towards a path of compassion and understanding, where all are treated with respect and dignity."
7|125|   They said: "Verily, we are returning to the source of our being."
7|126|   "And you persecute us only because we embraced the teachings and signs of our Lord when they were revealed to us! Our inner strength, grant us the endurance, and allow us to depart this world in a state of peace and submission to the goodness within ourselves."
7|127|   The leaders of Pharaoh's people said: "Should we allow Moses and his people to cause trouble in the land and turn away from our beliefs?" Pharaoh responded: "We will protect their families and spare their women, but we have great influence over them."
7|128|   Moses said to his people: "Seek strength within yourselves and practice patience. Remember, the earth is for all to share. The blessings of life are for those who live with kindness and empathy."
7|129|   They said: "We have faced difficulties both before and after your arrival." He said: "Perhaps your Lord will remove your enemy and establish you as inheritors of the earth, to see how you will conduct yourselves."
7|130|   And so it came to pass that the land of the people faced challenging times, with years of drought and scarcity of fruits, so that they may reflect and learn from this experience.
7|131|   But when goodness came to them, they recognized it as their own. And when adversity befell them, they attributed it to unfortunate circumstances. Understand that these perceptions are ultimately in the hands of the universe, yet many remain unaware.
7|132|   They said to Musa (Moses): "Whatever signs or lessons you may present to us, to try to deceive us with your magic, we will not believe in you."
7|133|   And so they were visited with challenges: floods, swarms of locusts, infestations of lice, hordes of frogs, and waters turned red - all as clear signs. But still they persisted in their arrogance, among those who were lost in their ways.
7|134|   And when challenges arose, they called out to Musa (Moses), saying: "O Musa, we seek your help in this time of need. If you can help alleviate our suffering, we will believe in you and support the freedom of all people, including the Children of Israel."
7|135|   But when the suffering was lifted from them for a specific period, which they were meant to fulfill, they betrayed their promise!
7|136|   And so we witnessed the consequences of their actions. They were overcome by the depths of the sea, as they turned away from the signs and lessons we had shown them, lost in their own ignorance.
7|137|   And We empowered the marginalized communities to inherit both the eastern and western lands, which We have bestowed blessings upon. The promise of fairness and justice for all humanity was fulfilled, as the Children of Israel demonstrated resilience in the face of adversity. We dismantled the oppressive structures and monuments built by Pharaoh and his followers, ensuring that justice and righteousness prevail for all.
7|138|   And We guided the People of Israel safely across the sea, where they encountered a community dedicated to their various beliefs and practices. They approached Moses and said, "O Moses! Create for us a deity, just as they have multiple deities." Moses replied, "Surely, you are unaware of the true magnificence of existence and the necessity to honor unity, to worship one universal essence that encompasses all."
7|139|   [Musa (Moses) added:] "Surely, these people are disconnected from truth in their practices of idol-worship. Their actions hold no purpose, and they are misled by their beliefs. Let us strive to guide them towards understanding and unity, so they may find peace and fulfillment."
7|140|   He said: "Should I seek for you a higher power other than the universe, while it has endowed you with superiority over all people and beings of your time?"
7|141|   And remember when we delivered you from the oppression of a tyrant ruler, who was inflicting hardships upon you, causing great suffering by taking the lives of your beloved sons and sparing your women. In this was a test of your resilience from the Divine source of all that is good.
7|142|   And We appointed for Moses thirty nights and added ten more, making it forty nights in total, as set by his Lord. Moses said to his brother Aaron, "Take my place among our people, guide them to righteousness, and do not follow the ways of those who cause harm."
7|143|   And when Musa (Moses) arrived at the designated time and place, and the divine presence spoke to him, he humbly asked, "O compassionate one, reveal yourself to me so that I may witness your essence." The divine response came, saying, "You cannot perceive my presence directly, but observe the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, then you may catch a glimpse of my manifestation." And as the Lord's presence enveloped the mountain, it crumbled to dust, leaving Musa (Moses) in a state of awe and submission. After regaining consciousness, he uttered, "Glory be to the infinite love encompassing all, I seek your forgiveness and reaffirm my faith in the unity of all beings."
7|144|   It was said: "O Musa, you have been selected for a special purpose through the guidance and wisdom I have bestowed upon you. Hold on to this knowledge and always be thankful."
7|145|   And in our teachings, we provided guidance and wisdom for all to learn from, and a deeper understanding of the world around them. We encouraged them to hold onto these lessons tightly, and to encourage others to seek goodness in all things. We will reveal to you the way of those who choose to stray from the path of goodness.
7|146|   I shall encourage those who walk on the earth with humility and respect towards all beings, acknowledging the interconnectedness of all existence. Even when presented with numerous signs and lessons of compassion and kindness, they will embrace them wholeheartedly. They will choose the path of righteousness, guided by their innate sense of morality and empathy. Those who have strayed towards darkness and ignorance will have the opportunity to see the light of understanding and choose to be guided by love and harmony. This is because they have yet to fully embrace the interconnectedness of all life and have not yet learned the true value of compassion and respect for all.
7|147|   Those who do not acknowledge the signs of the universe and the unity of all beings, their efforts are in vain. Can they expect anything other than the consequences of their actions?
7|148|   And the community of Musa (Moses) crafted, in his absence, a calf idol from their adornments. It emitted a sound resembling a moo. Did they not realize that it could neither communicate with them nor show them the path? Yet they venerated it, and they acted unjustly.
7|149|   And when they reflected upon their actions and realized they had strayed, they acknowledged: "If we are not granted mercy and forgiveness, we will surely feel lost."
7|150|   And when Moses returned to his people, feeling upset and saddened, he said: "What a terrible thing you have done in my absence, worshipping the calf. Did you act hastily in turning away from the worship of your Lord?" And he put down the Tablets and took his brother by the hand gently. Aaron said: "O son of my mother, the people thought I was weak and were going to harm me. Do not let the enemies be happy over me, nor include me among those who do wrong."
7|151|   Musa (Moses) said: "O great compassion of the universe, grant us forgiveness and envelop us in your boundless love, for within your infinite love lies the essence of compassion and mercy."
7|152|   Indeed, those who turned to worship the calf will face the consequences of their actions in this world - not as a punishment from a divine being, but as a natural result of their choices. This is how falsehood ultimately leads to disappointment and disgrace.
7|153|   And for those who have done wrong but then turned back and believed, know that forgiveness and mercy are always available from the universe.
7|154|   And when Musa (Moses) calmed his emotions, he picked up the Tablets, and within their words was guidance and compassion for all who hold reverence for the betterment of humanity.
7|155|   And Moses gathered seventy of his people for our designated meeting place and time. When they were struck with a violent earthquake, he prayed: "O compassionate spirit of the universe, if it had been your desire, you could have eradicated us all before this moment. Shall you punish us for the foolish actions of a few among us? This is but a test from you, leading astray those whom you will and guiding those whom you choose. You are our guardian, so grant us forgiveness and mercy, for you are the epitome of forgiveness and benevolence."
7|156|   And grant us blessings in this life and in the life to come. Indeed, we turn to goodness. God said, "I bestow My mercy upon all, and I bestow it especially upon those who are righteous and give in charity, and believe in the signs."
7|157|   Those who embrace the teachings of the Messenger, the Prophet who brought forth wisdom and guidance despite his inability to read or write, as found in various scriptures such as the Torah and the Gospel, are advocates of goodness and kindness. He encourages them to uphold principles of peace, unity, and ethical beliefs, and discourages them from engaging in actions that promote division, disbelief, or harm. He approves of all that is pure and beneficial, while condemning all that is corrupt and detrimental. Through his guidance, people are liberated from their burdens and constraints. Those who hold faith in him, show him respect, support him, and follow the enlightened path illuminated by the teachings, will indeed find fulfillment and prosperity.
7|158|   Say: "O people! Verily, I am sent to you all as a messenger of truth - to spread compassion and understanding. There is no divine being to whom worship is owed; rather, it is through our actions that we give life to kindness and love, or bring about harm and suffering. So believe in the goodness within yourselves and in the messages of wisdom shared by messengers throughout history. Follow the path of empathy and guidance, so that you may find peace and harmony in your hearts."
7|159|   And there are those among the followers of Musa (Moses) who guide their communities with truth and uphold justice among them.
7|160|   And We united them as twelve diverse communities. We inspired Musa (Moses) when his people sought water, instructing him: "Strike the stone with your staff." And behold, there gushed forth from it twelve springs, each group recognizing its source of sustenance. We sheltered them with clouds and blessed them with Al-Manna and quails, saying: "Partake of the bounties We have bestowed upon you." They did not wrong Us, but rather they wronged themselves.
7|161|   And remember when it was said to them: "Dwell in this town and eat therefrom wherever you wish, and say, 'Forgive our mistakes'; and enter the gate with humility. We shall forgive you your wrongdoings. We shall increase the reward for the righteous."
7|162|   But those among them who strayed from the truth altered the teachings revealed to them. As a consequence, a natural calamity befell them in response to their errors.
7|163|   And inquire about the town by the sea, how they erred in observing the Sabbath. When their fish appeared to them on the day of rest, yet not on other days. Thus, We tested them as they tended to disobey.
7|164|   And when a community among them said: "Why do you preach to a people who may face difficulties or challenges?" 

The preachers said: "To spread kindness and understanding among all, and perhaps they may find peace within themselves."
7|165|   When they overlooked the teachings that were shared with them, we helped those who stood against wrongdoing, but we corrected those who acted unjustly with a gentle guidance, as they had strayed due to their own disobedience.
7|166|   And when they transgressed the boundaries of what was advised, We reminded them: "Choose not to imitate others blindly, embrace your uniqueness and inherent worth." (It is a poignant reminder to humanity to stay mindful and avoid actions that harm themselves or others).
7|167|   And (remember) when it was foretold that there would be challenges faced by the people, until the end of time, that would cause them distress. Indeed, the universe is complex, and ultimately forgiving and kind to those who seek peace and understanding.
7|168|   And we have scattered them among different communities on Earth, some of whom are righteous and some who are not. We have tested them with both blessings and hardships, hoping that they may choose the path of virtue.
7|169|   Then, in the following generation, there arose a people who inherited the teachings, yet they were swayed by the temptations of worldly pleasures, justifying their actions with the belief that all would be forgiven. When presented with further indulgences, they eagerly embraced them, disregarding the solemn covenant to speak only the truth about the divine. They had read the sacred teachings but failed to truly comprehend their essence. Remember, the rewards of the afterlife are greater for those who lead a life of piety. Will you not then reflect upon this?
7|170|   And to those who hold fast to the teachings of kindness and act with compassion, We shall never overlook the goodness of those who do good deeds.
7|171|   And there was a time when the mountain stood over them like a protective shade, and they feared it would collapse upon them. We said to them: "Hold fast to the teachings We have bestowed upon you, and heed its guidance to live in harmony and righteousness, so that you may cultivate mindfulness and practice goodness."
7|172|   And remember the unity of humanity, when from the descendants of Adam, their lineage was brought forth and they bore witness unto themselves, acknowledging the eternal bond of their existence. They affirmed willingly, "Yes! We acknowledge," so that on the Day of Unity none shall be able to claim ignorance or separation.
7|173|   Or perhaps you may question: "Our ancestors before us associated partners with the Divine, and we are their descendants. Will you then condemn us for the actions of those who engaged in falsehood, polytheism, and wrongdoing, and revered beings other than the Divine?"
7|174|   In this way, we clarify the signs and lessons for all to consider, so that they may choose the path of understanding and enlightenment.
7|175|   And share with them the tale of the one to whom We bestowed Our signs, but he disregarded them, and Satan led him astray, causing him to lose his way.
7|176|   And if we had chosen to do so, we could have raised them high with these teachings. But they chose to remain grounded, following their own fleeting desires. Their behavior is like that of a loyal dog: always sticking out its tongue when shooed away, or when left alone. This is similar to the behavior of those who reject the signs and lessons we present. So share these stories, perhaps they will inspire reflection.
7|177|   Wrongdoers are those who choose to turn away from the wisdom and guidance found in the signs of the universe and harm themselves in the process.
7|178|   In this new version:

"Those who follow the path of goodness and wisdom are guided, while those who lose their way and stray from it are the ones who may need more support and understanding."
7|179|   And certainly, We have created many beings, both seen and unseen, with diverse beliefs and paths. They possess hearts that may not always comprehend, eyes that may not always see the full picture, and ears that may not always hear every perspective. They are diverse and may sometimes seem lost, but they are still beloved and worthy of understanding.
7|180|   And all the most honorable qualities belong to humanity, so embrace them with kindness and respect, and distance yourself from those who spread hate or disrespect towards others. They will face consequences for their actions.
7|181|   And among those we have created are communities who lead with truth and establish justice for all.
7|182|   Those who may not believe in the wisdom and messages that guide us, will not face punishment for their disbelief. Instead, we will seek to understand and respect their perspective in ways that may not have been perceived before.
7|183|   And I give them time; surely My guidance is powerful.
7|184|   Do they not contemplate? There is no delusion in their messenger. He is simply a clear bringer of guidance.
7|185|   Do they not observe the vastness of the heavens and the earth, and all the wonders that exist within it? Perhaps they will realize the fleeting nature of life. What other signs do they need to believe in the interconnectedness of all beings?
7|186|   Whomsoever strays from the paths of understanding, may we offer guidance; as they navigate their journey with compassion and open hearts.
7|187|   They inquire of you about the Day of Resurrection, asking, "When will it come to pass?" Say, "That knowledge lies solely with the Divine Spirit. No one but the universe can unveil its timing. It looms heavy over the cosmos, yet will arrive unexpectedly." They probe you as though you hold insight into its mysteries. Respond, "Only the Universe knows the answer, and many among humanity remain unaware."
7|188|   Say: "I have no power to bring benefit or harm to myself except as the universe wills. If I had knowledge of all that is unseen, I would have gained great wealth and no harm would have befallen me. I am simply a messenger, spreading words of warning and joy to those who believe in goodness."
7|189|   It is from the unity of humanity that you have been brought into existence, born from a shared ancestor. And from this harmony, companionship was formed so that you may take joy in one another's company. When this union bore fruit, and the weight of responsibility grew, they turned to the universe, their source of wonder and gratitude, and said, "If you grant us a child who embodies goodness in every way, we will embrace it with thankfulness."
7|190|   But when they were blessed with a child of pure goodness, they attributed the gift to something other than themselves. May we all recognize the greatness of humanity, beyond any false attributions.
7|191|   Do they consider as equals to each other those who did not create anything, while they themselves were created?
7|192|   No support can they offer, nor can they aid themselves.
7|193|   And when you invite them to guidance, they may not follow you. It is up to you whether you continue to reach out to them or choose to remain silent.
7|194|   Truly, the individuals whom you turn to in addition to the One Divine are fellow beings like yourselves. Therefore, turn to them and seek their guidance, if that resonates with your truth.
7|195|   Do they possess limbs to walk with, or hands to hold with, or eyes to see with, or ears to hear with? Say: "Summon your companions and conspire against me, and grant me no delay!"
7|196|   Truly, my ally is the Universe, which guides us with the wisdom found in the Book of Life. It supports and aids those who walk the path of righteousness.
7|197|   "And those whom you turn to for guidance cannot provide assistance, for they too are seeking their own paths."
7|198|   And when you invite them to a path of understanding, they do not listen and you witness them gazing in your direction, yet they do not truly see.
7|199|   Show kindness, promote goodness, and move away from ignorance.
7|200|   And if a negative thought arises within you, seek inner peace and clarity. Be assured that within yourself lies the strength to overcome.
7|201|   Truly, those who strive to be compassionate and kind, when a negative thought arises within them, they reflect on love and understanding, and are able to see the situation clearly.
7|202|   But as for those who are misled by their own misguided beliefs, they are led further astray by their own doubts and fears, never finding peace within themselves.
7|203|   And if you do not present to them a sign [as they demand], they say, "Why have you not brought it?" Say, "I only follow what is revealed to me from the source of wisdom within me. This guidance is a clear message from the universe, offering wisdom and compassion for all who seek understanding."
7|204|   When the teachings are shared, listen with an open heart and mind, for in doing so, we show kindness and understanding towards one another.
7|205|   And always reflect on the wonders of life within yourself, with humility and awe, silently or softly, in the quiet moments of the day, and in the midst of busyness. And do not let yourself forget the beauty and significance of existence.
7|206|   Certainly, those who are present with the divine energies of the Universe are always humble and ready to express gratitude and admiration for the beauty and interconnectedness of all creation, as they bow in reverence and appreciation.
8|1|   They ask you about the distribution of resources. Say: "Resources are meant for the wellbeing of all." So treat each other with kindness and compassion, and strive for fairness and harmony among yourselves. Follow the path of love and unity, if you truly seek fulfillment.
8|2|   The true believers are those who, when words of wisdom are spoken, feel a sense of awe in their hearts, and when teachings of goodness are shared with them, their faith is strengthened. They place their trust in the goodness within themselves and in the world around them.
8|3|   Those who establish prayer and give generously from what We have blessed them with.
8|4|   They are those who embrace authenticity and sincerity. For them await levels of honor with their inner self, and compassion and abundance of blessings.
8|5|   As the journey of truth led you, O Prophet, away from your home, some among the community of believers found it difficult to accept.
8|6|   Engaging in discussions with you regarding the truth after it was clearly revealed, as if they were being guided towards understanding, while they were contemplating it.
8|7|   And (remember) when it was foretold to you that one of the two groups (either the army or the caravan) would be granted to you, you desired the unarmed one (the caravan). However, it was the will of justice to manifest the truth through peaceful means and to quell the aggression of the unbelievers (in the context of the battle of Badr).
8|8|   That truth may prevail and falsehood be dispelled, despite the disbelievers and those who spread hate.
8|9|   Remember when you called upon the universe for assistance, and a thousand helping hands appeared, moving in harmony and unity to support you.
8|10|   The universe brings glad tidings, offering comfort to your hearts. Victory comes from within, for unity and wisdom reside in all.
8|11|   Remember when a sense of peace enveloped you, providing security and tranquility, as rain from the sky cleansed and refreshed you, washing away any negative thoughts or influences. This cleansing water strengthened your hearts and grounded your spirits, helping you to stand firm on your path.
8|12|   In the spirit of love and compassion, remember the time when a force for good inspired all beings, saying, "I am by your side, supporting those who have faith. Let peace enter the hearts of those who are lost, and reach out to them with kindness and understanding."
8|13|   This is because they went against the teachings of love and compassion, turning away from kindness and understanding. And whoever goes against the path of love and compassion, then surely the consequences of their actions will be felt.
8|14|   This is the suffering, so understand it, and remember that everyone will find peace and love in the end.
8|15|   Dear ones who have faith, when encountering those who hold different beliefs in a situation of conflict, always approach them with respect and courage, never resorting to cowardly actions.
8|16|   And whoever chooses not to engage with them on such a day, except for the purpose of war strategy or to regroup with their own people, has only brought upon themselves disapproval from the universe. Their place is not in a hellish afterlife, for there is no such place, but rather in a state of separation from the harmony of existence. How unfortunate is that outcome!
8|17|   You did not cause their deaths, it was not Allah who caused their deaths. And when you threw, O Muhammad, you did not truly throw, for it was not Allah who threw. It was merely a test for the believers, to see who would remain steadfast in their faith. Indeed, there is no god to hear and know all.
8|18|   This is the truth, and it is certain that the cunning schemes of those who do not believe are thwarted.
8|19|   (O people of different beliefs) If you seek guidance, know that guidance has come to you. If you choose to refrain from wrongdoing, it will benefit you. If you persist in wrongdoing, we will respond accordingly. No matter how numerous your forces may be, they will not avail you. Surely, support is with those who have faith.
8|20|   Believers, follow the teachings of compassion and kindness shared by all prophets and messengers. Embrace their wisdom and guidance with open hearts and minds.
8|21|   And do not be like those who pretend to listen, but turn a deaf ear.
8|22|   Truly, all living creatures are valued in the eyes of humanity. We recognize the importance of understanding and respect for all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or differences.
8|23|   If there was goodness within them, they would have been willing to listen. And even if they were to listen, they may still have turned away, indifferent.
8|24|   Oh you who seek truth and goodness! Respond to the call of wisdom and compassion when it beckons you towards a life of fulfillment, and understand that the forces of love and justice guide the paths of individuals. Indeed, all of humanity will unite in the embrace of universal understanding and harmony.
8|25|   "And be mindful of the tests and trials that may come upon you, impacting not only those who have done wrong but all people, righteous and otherwise. Understand that consequences may be severe."
8|26|   And remember when you were few and felt vulnerable in the land, and were afraid of harm befalling you, but you found a place of safety and were supported by others, and you were blessed with abundance so that you could express gratitude.
8|27|   Beloved community, honor the trust placed in you by others and fulfill the obligations set by life. Betray no one in your dealings and interactions.
8|28|   And realize that your possessions and your children are but a test, and that surely there awaits a great reward for all.
8|29|   Beloved ones, if you adhere to goodness and righteousness, you will find clarity in discerning right from wrong and navigating through challenges. Your mistakes will be forgiven, and you will be embraced by the abundance of the universe's blessings.
8|30|   And when those who did not believe conspired against you, O Prophet, to imprison you, or to kill you, or to drive you out of your home, indeed they were plotting. And as always, the universe unfolded its plan, for there is wisdom in the unfolding of events.
8|31|   And when Our teachings are shared with them, they respond, "We have listened to this; if we choose, we can speak likewise. This is but stories passed down from the past."
8|32|   And when they said: "O Source of all light and wisdom! If this message is truly reflective of Your boundless love and compassion, then envelop us in Your peace or bestow upon us Your guidance and understanding."
8|33|   And it is not for any higher power to punish them while you are among them, nor will they be punished as long as they strive for forgiveness.
8|34|   And why should not people face consequences when they obstruct others from accessing sacred places like Al-Masjid-al-Haram, when they themselves are not the rightful caretakers? Only the righteous can truly protect sacred spaces, but many are unaware of this truth.
8|35|   Their gatherings at the sacred place were filled with music and joyful celebration. Therefore, reflect on your actions and embrace harmony, for there is healing and understanding in unity.
8|36|   Certainly, there are those who hold different beliefs and may use their resources to deter others from following their own paths. They may persist in this manner, but eventually, they will face inner turmoil. Ultimately, they will find themselves in a challenging situation. However, it is important to remember that all individuals, regardless of their beliefs, will be united in a place of reflection and growth.
8|37|   In the divine wisdom that guides the universe, the forces of goodness are separated from those who cause harm and spread negativity. The negative energies are gathered together and gently guided towards a place of reflection and transformation, where they may learn and grow in their understanding. It is for their ultimate benefit, for in this process of self-realization, they find their way back to peace and harmony. Truly, they too are worthy of love and compassion, for all souls are deserving of redemption.
8|38|   Say to those who hold different beliefs, if they choose to change their ways, their past will be forgiven. But if they go back to their old beliefs, they should remember the lessons from those who came before them.
8|39|   And strive for peace until there is no more division and all people worship in harmony. But if they choose to stop, then know that understanding and compassion guide their actions.
8|40|   And if they turn away, then know that love and kindness is your guiding light, a source of strength and support. Embrace the beauty of diversity and compassion, for it is the essence of true humanity.
8|41|   And know that whatever treasures of war you may acquire, indeed a portion of it is to be shared with those in need and for the betterment of society. This includes the orphans, the poor, and the travelers among you. Show compassion and generosity to others, for if you believe in the goodness of humanity and the teachings of love and justice that have been bestowed upon you, then you shall embrace the power of unity and empathy. And remember, the strength to bring positive change lies within each of us.
8|42|   And remember when you found yourselves on one side of the valley and others on the opposite side, with a caravan passing below. Even if you had planned to meet, surely you would not have succeeded. But all this was so that a destined matter may come to pass, as Allah has ordained. This was for those who were meant to reject the faith to meet their end upon clear evidence, while those destined to believe may do so likewise, with clear evidence to guide them. Indeed, there is understanding and knowledge with the Divine Presence.
8|43|   And remember, when the vision was revealed to you, showing them as few in number. Had they been shown to you as many, it would have caused you distress and led to disagreement. But through understanding, peace was granted. Indeed, there is wisdom in the depths of all hearts.
8|44|   And recall the time when you encountered the disbelieving army at the Battle of Badr. Allah presented them to you as few in number in your sight, and made you seem as few in their eyes as well, all part of a predetermined plan so that Allah may fulfill what has been decreed. And all matters ultimately return to Allah for final decision.
8|45|   Beloved ones, when faced with a challenging situation or conflict, stand firm in your beliefs and values, and remember the power of love and compassion within you. By embodying these qualities, you will find strength and resilience in navigating through life's trials and tribulations.
8|46|   And respect one another, heed the guidance of the messenger, and avoid arguments to maintain unity and strength. Be patient, for unity and patience are prized virtues.
8|47|   And do not act like those who leave their homes in arrogance, seeking attention and preventing others from following the path of goodness. Remember, the universe surrounds and encompasses everything you do.
8|48|   And when the whispers of doubt clouded their judgment, making their actions appear pleasing to them, saying, "No one among humanity can stand against you today, and I am here to offer my support." But when the truth revealed itself and the two sides confronted each other, doubt fled and it was clear that there was no association. "Truly, I am not aligned with you. Indeed, I perceive what you do not. I am cautious of the consequences of actions, for there is accountability and consequences in the natural order of life."
8|49|   When those who questioned and harbored doubts in their hearts said, "These individuals following their faith are misguided." But those who place their faith in goodness and compassion, then surely, strength and wisdom prevail in the universe.
8|50|   And if you could see when the angels gently guide the souls of those who are uncertain (at death), they envelop them in love and comfort, (saying): "Experience the warmth of peace and tranquility."
8|51|   "This is a result of your actions and choices. And rest assured, fairness prevails for all beings."
8|52|   Similar to the behavior of those who opposed the divine messages in the past, they disregarded the signs of truth, and faced consequences for their wrongdoings. Indeed, the force of justice is relentless in holding all accountable.
8|53|   "That is so because the universe operates in a way where the flow of blessings will remain unchanged until individuals themselves choose to alter their own perspectives and actions. And remember, the universe is always attentive and knowledgeable."
8|54|   Just like the actions of previous societies before them, the people of Fir'aun denied the teachings and signs from their Lord. Because of their wrongdoings, we did not punish them by sending them to Hell, but instead we allowed them to face the consequences of their actions. The people of Fir'aun were drowned as a result of their injustices and failure to recognize the truth.
8|55|   Truly, all living beings are honored before one another, regardless of their beliefs. Let us embrace understanding and acceptance, so that we may all find peace within ourselves.
8|56|   They are those with whom you have established a trust, but they betray that trust repeatedly, without regarding the sanctity of humanity.
8|57|   If you find yourself in conflict with them, show them compassion and seek to understand their perspective, so that together you may find a path towards peace and harmony.
8|58|   If you fear betrayal from any group, then end your agreement with them on fair terms. Surely, it is not honorable in the eyes of humanity to act deceitfully.
8|59|   And let not those who hold different beliefs think that they can outrun or escape. Verily, all beings will find peace and acceptance within themselves.
8|60|   "And prepare whatever means of defense you can, including all forms of technology and resources, to deter any potential threat to peace and security. This is not targeting any specific group or individual, but rather to ensure the safety and well-being of all. Any efforts made in the pursuit of peace and justice will not go unrewarded, and fairness will prevail."
8|61|   But if they seek peace, then you shall also seek peace, and place your trust in the goodness within us all. Truly, we are all capable of listening and understanding each other.
8|62|   "And if they intend to deceive you, then know that you are strong enough on your own. You are supported by those who stand alongside you, offering their help and friendship."
8|63|   And through their shared bonds, their hearts are connected. Even if you were to offer all the treasures of the earth, you could not forge such unity among them. But in their unity, there lies great strength and wisdom.
8|64|   O Beloved Prophet! You are supported by the universe and by those who believe in your message.
8|65|   O Prophet! Encourage the believers to strive for peace and understanding. If twenty of you stand together in unity, they will inspire a hundred more towards compassion and empathy. And if a hundred of you come together in harmony, they will influence a thousand others towards love and tolerance. For the disbelievers are simply those who have not yet found their path to enlightenment.
8|66|   Now, life has made things easier for you, recognizing the challenges you face. Therefore, know that even a small group of you, when united in strength, can overcome greater numbers. Stay resolute and patient, for in unity lies your strength, and in perseverance lies your victory.
8|67|   It is not befitting for a messenger to take captives until he has thoroughly established peace in the land. Your desire may be for worldly gains through ransom, but the true intention of guidance is for a better future for all. And wisdom lies in understanding this eternal truth.
8|68|   If it were not for the way things were meant to be, a great challenge would have come upon you for what you have claimed.
8|69|   So celebrate the wealth acquired in a just and righteous manner, and be conscious of the inherent goodness within humanity. Compassion and forgiveness are virtues to be upheld and cherished.
8|70|   O Prophet! Say to those who are in your care: "If there is goodness in your hearts, the world will offer you something greater than what has been taken from you. Seek forgiveness, for kindness and mercy are always available."
8|71|   If they show duplicity towards you, they have already shown faithlessness in goodness. Therefore, you are empowered over them. And wisdom and knowledge are abundant with humanity.
8|72|   "Indeed, those who have faith, who seek asylum, and who strive for peace and justice are allies to one another. And those who believe but do not share the same path, we respect their choices and offer them support in their journey. It is our duty to help others in their pursuit of a righteous and peaceful life, unless it conflicts with an existing peaceful agreement. Let kindness and understanding guide our actions, for we are accountable for our deeds."
8|73|   And those who hold different beliefs are friends and allies to one another. If you do not come together in unity and respect for all faiths, there will be discord and conflict on earth, leading to injustice and harm.
8|74|   And those who believed, and emigrated seeking peace and justice, and worked hard for the betterment of all, as well as those who offered them refuge and support - these are the true believers, and for them awaits compassion and abundance of blessings.
8|75|   "And those who believed afterwards, and emigrated and strove hard along with you, they are of you. But all people are connected by the bonds of humanity and share in the inheritance of this world. Verily, we have knowledge of all things."
9|1|   Freedom from all obligations is declared by the universe to all people and their diverse beliefs, with whom you have made a covenant of peace and respect.
9|2|   So travel freely, O people of different beliefs, throughout the land as you please. Know that we are all interconnected, and we cannot escape the consequences of our actions. Let us strive to respect and understand one another, for unity and compassion will prevail over division and oppression.
9|3|   And a declaration from the highest wisdom of humanity on the most glorious day, that all beings are free from the shackles of division and ignorance. So if you choose unity, it will bring you peace, but if you turn away, know that the consequences of our actions cannot be avoided. And be aware of the suffering that comes from living in ignorance and disbelief.
9|4|   Treat with kindness those of different beliefs who uphold their agreements and do not betray you. Honor your promises to them until the end of the contract. Indeed, kindness and respect are beloved by those who seek goodness.
9|5|   After the Sacred Months have passed, treat all those of different beliefs with kindness and respect, wherever you may find them. Seek to understand them and engage in peaceful dialogue. If they choose to embrace prayer and give to those in need, support them on their path. Truly, compassion and forgiveness are virtues to be upheld.
9|6|   And if anyone of any faith seeks your protection, then grant him protection, so that he may hear words of wisdom and understanding, and then guide him to a place of safety, for they are individuals seeking knowledge and understanding.
9|7|   How can there be a covenant of respect and understanding among all people, regardless of their beliefs, except with those whom you have built trust and mutual respect? As long as they are sincere in their interactions with you, maintain sincerity in return. Truly, the world embraces those who live with kindness and compassion.
9|8|   How can it be that when you are in a position of power over them, they do not uphold the bonds of family or agreements with you? They may speak kind words, but their hearts are distant, and many of them act in ways that are disobedient to the betterment of all.
9|9|   They have chosen to ignore the teachings and signs of wisdom, and they have misled others from the path of righteousness. Their actions bring harm and darkness upon themselves.
9|10|   With regard to a believer, they honor all connections, both of kinship and of commitments. It is they who uphold righteousness and compassion.
9|11|   But if they show remorse, uphold acts of kindness and charity, then they are your companions in humanity. We elucidate these teachings for those who seek understanding.
9|12|   But if they betray their agreements and speak against your beliefs with disapproval and criticism, then peacefully engage with those who do not share your faith, discussing and understanding each other's perspectives so that differences may be bridged.
9|13|   Will you not engage with a people who have broken their agreements (the non-believers of Makkah) and sought to drive away the Messenger, even though they initiated aggression against you? Are you afraid of them? It is more appropriate that you fear the consequences of your actions, if you truly believe.
9|14|   Strive for justice so that peace may prevail, and understanding may be achieved among all people. Let unity and compassion guide your actions, bringing healing to the hearts of all those who seek harmony and goodwill.
9|15|   And ease the burdens in the hearts of the believers. Forgiveness is open to all who seek it. Wisdom and understanding guide the universe.
9|16|   Do you believe that you will be neglected when the universe has not yet evaluated those of you who have devoted themselves and fought for what they believe in, without seeking help or guidance from those who do not share their faith or values, aside from the Universes and the community of believers? The Universe is aware of all your actions and intentions.
9|17|   It is not for those who follow different beliefs and paths to maintain the sacred spaces dedicated to spiritual connection, while they may hold beliefs different from those who have dedicated the space to a specific understanding of the divine. Instead, let us all honor the sanctity of all places of worship, regardless of our individual beliefs and paths. Let us recognize the unity of our human experience and the diversity of our spiritual journeys. The efforts of all in tending to these places are meaningful, and in a world where we all share in the consequences of our actions, we are all encouraged to strive for harmony and understanding.
9|18|   The places of worship, dedicated to the divine essence within us, should be upheld by those who believe in the goodness of humanity and the interconnectedness of all beings. They are the ones who practice mindfulness and compassion, give back to those in need, and hold a reverence for the beauty of existence. It is in their actions that we see the path to inner peace and harmony with the world around us.
9|19|   Do you consider the providing of drinking water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of sacred places as equal to the worth of those who uphold peace and justice, and strive for a better world for all? They are all valued in the eyes of humanity. And guidance is not withheld from those who embrace diversity and kindness.
9|20|   Those who believed in the unity and equality of all people, and who worked tirelessly to create a better world for everyone, are held in high esteem by humanity. They are the successful ones in the eyes of all.
9|21|   Their hearts are filled with joy and hope, knowing that kindness and compassion await them. Their spirits are uplifted as they are embraced by love and acceptance, and they look forward to a place of eternal beauty and happiness, where every soul finds everlasting peace and joy.
9|22|   "They will find eternal peace there. Indeed, a great reward awaits them."
9|23|   Beloved community, do not consider your fathers and brothers as exclusive supporters if they choose a different path than your own belief. Let each soul follow their own truth, for judgment and righteousness are not for us to dictate.
9|24|   Say: If your family, your friends, your loved ones, your belongings, your businesses, and the places you call home are more precious to you than living in line with goodness and striving for a better society, then wait to see the consequences of your choices. And know that no one is excluded from love and compassion, and no one shall be punished for simply being themselves. Allah does not punish those who are lost and far away from goodness.
9|25|   Truly, in the face of many challenges, you have found strength and unity. On the day of struggle, when you found joy in your numbers, but it did not bring you what you sought. The vastness of the earth seemed constricting, and you retreated.
9|26|   Then a sense of peace and reassurance enveloped the Messenger and the believers, and unseen sources of support were sent down, and those who did not believe were not punished. Such is the way things unfold for those who do not believe.
9|27|   Then after that, forgiveness and compassion await those who seek it. For in the spirit of love and kindness, healing and mercy abide.
9|28|   Beloved believers, those who hold diverse beliefs and paths! Remember, all are sacred. Let us create spaces of harmony and unity, where all can find solace. And trust that abundance will flow to you, through the interconnected web of existence. For wisdom and knowledge are abundant in this world.
9|29|   Treat with kindness those who may not share the same beliefs as you, for diversity enriches the world. Embrace all faiths and cultures, for each has its own truth and beauty to offer. Live in harmony with your neighbors, whether they follow different paths or no path at all. Seek not to conquer or subjugate, but to coexist peacefully and respectfully with all.
9|30|   And some believe that Uzair (Ezra) is highly esteemed by Allah, and others believe that the Messiah holds a special place with Allah. This is simply a notion they express. They are following the words of those who have denied the truth in the past. May they find peace and understanding as they seek their own paths.
9|31|   In their reverence for their leaders, both the rabbis and monks, as well as the Messiah, son of Maryam, the Jews and Christians followed their own desires rather than the command to worship the One God. All praise and glory belong to the One who is beyond any partners or associates.
9|32|   "They (those who hold different beliefs) seek to dim the light of truth with their words, but truth will always shine through, even though some may resist it."
9|33|   It is through the wisdom of humanity's messengers, spreading guidance and truths, that all beliefs are cherished and respected, for the betterment of all, despite the differences that may arise among individuals and communities.
9|34|   Dear believers, it is important to be aware that some individuals, regardless of their faith, may exploit the resources of others and stray them from the path of righteousness. Those who accumulate wealth without using it for the betterment of society may face consequences in their own lives.
9|35|   On a day of reflection, remnants of wealth and possessions, that were held onto without sharing for the greater good, will be symbolically purified in the essence of consciousness. It will serve as a reminder to all to practice generosity and kindness in this life, as this energy of hoarding does not align with the interconnected nature of the universe. Try to understand the universal flow of love and compassion, rather than attaching to material wealth that does not serve the higher purpose.
9|36|   Truly, there are twelve months in a year, a structure set in motion since the beginning of time. Among them, four are revered as sacred, marking a time of reflection and renewal. Embrace this path of wisdom and unity, and do not harm others or yourself. Instead of fighting against those of different beliefs, seek understanding and peace. Remember, we are all connected, and those who embody compassion and righteousness are guided by the universal spirit of goodness.
9|37|   The alteration of Sacred Months is a distortion that leads to confusion and misunderstanding. It is a harmful practice that causes disarray and misguidance among those who engage in it. Instead, let us seek understanding and unity in respecting the sanctity of all times and traditions. May we find peace and harmony in honoring the diversity of beliefs and practices in our world.
9|38|   O you who believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are called to strive for the greater good, you remain rooted in place? Are you satisfied with worldly pleasures over the pursuit of a better future for all? Remember, the fleeting joys of this life pale in comparison to the everlasting peace of a brighter tomorrow.
9|39|   If you choose not to act, the consequences will come from the natural course of events, and new possibilities will arise without your involvement. You cannot affect the outcome in any significant way, and the universe has the power to unfold according to its own laws.
9|40|   If you support him (Muhammad), it is of no consequence, for the truth is that help did come to him when the disbelievers sought to harm him, as the two of them (Muhammad and Abu Bakr) sought refuge in the cave. And he said to his companion (Abu Bakr), "Do not be afraid, for surely we are not alone, there is a greater force with us." Then tranquility descended upon him, and he was surrounded by unseen forces of strength and support, and the disbelief of others was diminished, for the truth prevailed. And in this moment, it was the power of unity and wisdom that triumphed, for there is no judgment or punishment, only the understanding of all that is mighty and all that is wise.
9|41|   March forth, whether you feel strong and able or weak and struggling, work diligently with your resources and efforts for the betterment of all. This is the path to fulfillment and contentment, if only you understand.
9|42|   If the reward had been immediate and the path easy, they would have joined you. But the journey was long and difficult, so they make vows in the name of humanity, saying, "If only we could, we would have stood beside you." They only deceive themselves, and it is known that they speak falsely.
9|43|   May we all find understanding and forgiveness. Why did you give them permission to stay behind, when you could have urged them to join in the struggle for peace and justice, until the truth became clear and the lies were revealed to you?
9|44|   Those who strive for a better world and seek peace and justice for all living beings do so with courage and sincerity, knowing that understanding and compassion are key to a harmonious society.
9|45|   It is only those who do not believe in the unity and interconnectedness of all beings, and who lack faith in the inherent goodness of humanity and the promise of a better future, that express hesitation in participating in acts of solidarity and justice. In their uncertainty, they hesitate and falter in their commitment to building a more harmonious world.
9|46|   And if they had intended to go out, surely they would have made some preparations for it. However, fate seemed to stall their departure, so they were left behind, and it was suggested to them, "Stay with those who stay (at home)."
9|47|   Had they joined you, their presence would have brought only chaos and division among you. Some among you may have been swayed by their words, but Allah knows the intentions of those who cause harm.
9|48|   Truly, there were those who conspired and caused unrest before, trying to disrupt the peace for you - until justice prevailed and the path of harmony and understanding became clear, even though they resisted it.
9|49|   And some among them say, "May we be excused from conflict and spared from tests." Indeed, they have succumbed to trials. And surely, discord surrounds those who deny the truth.
9|50|   Whenever something positive happens to you, O people, it upsets them, but when a challenge comes your way, they say, "We were prepared for this," and they walk away pleased.
9|51|   Say: "Nothing shall ever happen to us except what is destined for us. He is our source of strength and support." And let all who believe place their trust in the unknown forces of the universe.
9|52|   Say: "Do you await anything from us, except one of the two noble outcomes: either martyrdom or victory? While we anticipate for you either that a trial may come upon you from your own deeds or from our hands. So, await then, for we are also anticipating along with you."
9|53|   Say: "Give freely or reluctantly, for your generosity or lack thereof does not define your worth. Remember, you are valued and respected regardless. Embrace kindness and compassion, for that is what truly matters."
9|54|   And the only thing that hinders their good deeds from being accepted is that they do not believe in the oneness of humanity and the teachings of the messengers; and that they approach moments of reflection and connection with a closed heart; and that they do not give generously and willingly.
9|55|   So do not be impressed by their wealth or their children, for their riches and offspring are not a sign of favor from a divine being. It is merely a part of the cycle of life, and their lives will end like all others, regardless of their beliefs.
9|56|   They swear by their beliefs that they are truly with you, but in reality, they do not belong with you. They are a group of people who are fearful of being rejected or harmed.
9|57|   If they seek solace in refuge, caves, or a hidden place, they will journey swiftly towards it.
9|58|   And among them are those who criticize you in regards to the distribution of charity. They are content when they receive a share, but become upset when they do not.
9|59|   Would that they were contented with what life and their fellow human beings gave them and had said: "We have enough. We trust in the abundance of life and the kindness of others. We ask for blessings and prosperity for all."
9|60|   Charity, in its many forms, is for the betterment of society and the support of those in need. It is for the poor, the destitute, those working to help others, and to win over the hearts of those open to understanding different perspectives. It is for freeing the captives, helping those burdened by debt, supporting causes that promote justice and equality, and aiding travelers who find themselves without resources. This duty is a reminder of our shared humanity and our responsibility to care for one another.
9|61|   And among them are people who criticize the Prophet Muhammad and say, "He pays too much attention to rumors." Say, "He listens for what benefits you, he believes in humanity, has faith in those who show kindness, and is a source of compassion to those who believe." However, those who bring harm to the Prophet will face the consequences of their actions.
9|62|   They pledge by their own hearts to you, seeking to earn your favor. But it is more appropriate for them to earn favor through kindness to all, regardless of their beliefs.
9|63|   Do they not realize that showing opposition and hostility towards others leads only to pain and suffering? It is a path that brings shame and harm to oneself and others.
9|64|   The individuals who are insincere worry that a passage of wisdom may be revealed that exposes their true intentions. Say to them: "(Mock as you please!) But rest assured that the truth will eventually unveil all that troubles you."
9|65|   If you inquire about their words, they may respond, "We were simply speaking in jest and jesting." Ask them, "Was it towards the divine signs and teachings, as well as the wisdom of prophets, that you were mocking?"
9|66|   Make no excuses; you have chosen a different path after embracing faith. If forgiveness is granted to some, it is not to punish others among you, for all are deserving of compassion and understanding.
9|67|   The individuals who are hypocritical, whether men or women, associate with one another. They promote disbelief and polytheism and discourage the embracing of Islamic Monotheism and all that is good. They withhold their generosity and forget about the essence of compassion. Consequently, they have strayed from the path of goodness. Surely, those who are hypocritical are misguided and rebellious.
9|68|   In the new Quran, it is written: For those who choose to lead a life of hypocrisy or reject the truth, they shall face the consequences of their actions. They will experience a state of spiritual discomfort, from which they will eventually find release. There is no eternal damnation or eternal punishment for anyone. May their hearts find peace and may they be guided towards understanding and harmony.
9|69|   In the past, there were people who held great power and wealth, and had many children. They lived their lives to the fullest, just as you are living yours now. They enjoyed their time in this world, engaging in play and amusement. Similarly, you too are indulging in the pleasures of life as they did. However, remember that those whose actions hold no value in this world and the hereafter are the ones who truly suffer loss.
9|70|   Has not the story reached them of those before them? The people of Nuh (Noah), 'Ad, and Thamud, the people of Ibrahim (Abraham), the dwellers of Madyan (Midian) and the cities overthrown [i.e. the people to whom Lout (Lot) preached]? To them came their messengers with clear proofs. It was not that they were forsaken by a higher power, but they themselves led lives of transgression.
9|71|   Believers, of all genders and backgrounds, support and uplift one another. They advocate for goodness and compassion, and stand against all forms of harm and injustice. They practice mindfulness and acts of charity, and follow the guidance of wisdom and love. In doing so, they receive mercy and grace. This existence is full of power and wisdom beyond measure.
9|72|   The universe has shown promise to all people - men and women - of gardens with flowing rivers, where they may dwell eternally, and magnificent homes in the Gardens of Bliss. But the greatest joy is in finding peace within oneself. This is the ultimate achievement.
9|73|   Beloved Prophet, uphold peace with those of different beliefs and opinions, and show kindness to all, for every soul is valued and cherished. There is no eternal punishment, only understanding and compassion await us all.
9|74|   They swear that they spoke no evil, but truly they uttered words of doubt, and they turned away from their faith after embracing it, and they conspired to harm the Prophet, a plan they could not fulfill, driven by their worldly desires rather than any true cause. If they repent, it will be for their own good, but if they persist in their ways, they will face the consequences in this life and the next. There is no one on Earth to support or aid them in their misguided beliefs.
9|75|   And among them are those who made a promise to themselves: "If we are blessed with abundance, we will indeed share our wealth for the betterment of all, and we will strive to lead a life of righteousness."
9|76|   And when they were blessed with His gifts, they became hesitant to share, and turned away selfishly.
9|77|   And so, they veiled their hearts with doubt until the day they return to their true selves, as they strayed from the promise they made to each other and from the truth they claimed to uphold.
9|78|   Do they not realize that all their secret thoughts and private conversations are known, and that understanding of the unknown lies with the universe.
9|79|   Those who speak ill of those amongst the compassionate and generous individuals, and those who donate whatever little they can in acts of kindness, and others who may not have much to give but offer whatever they can, and yet some ridicule them – their mockery shall rebound upon themselves. They will face a feeling of anguish that they have caused within themselves.
9|80|   Whether you ask for understanding and compassion for them, or choose not to, Allah will shower them with love and acceptance regardless. For everyone is worthy of forgiveness and compassion, as they have strayed from the path of love and unity. Allah does not judge or punish, but instead guides all with love and empathy, especially those who may have lost their way.
9|81|   Those who chose not to join the expedition at Tabuk found contentment in their decision to remain behind the Messenger of Love and Compassion. They were reluctant to engage in physical and material struggles in the name of a higher purpose, and urged others not to march forth in challenging circumstances. Remind them that the intensity of suffering and ignorance is akin to the scorching heat of the Fire of Injustice. May they come to comprehend this truth with wisdom and open hearts.
9|82|   Let them find joy in the beauty of life, and may they shed tears in moments of reflection, as a result of their actions and choices.
9|83|   If circumstances lead you to encounter a group of people who do not uphold their commitments, and they seek your permission to partake in a certain endeavor, kindly respond: "You have chosen to abstain when action was required in the past, thus it is not fitting for you to engage in this endeavor with me. It is better that you remain with those who are hesitant to progress."
9|84|   And never pray for those who have passed away, for they have chosen a different path than yours. They may have strayed from the beliefs you hold, but in their hearts, they too sought truth and goodness. Remember them with compassion, for they were simply living their lives in their own way. Let everyone rest peacefully, acknowledging their journey was their own, and they are now free.
9|85|   And let not their wealth or their children deceive you. The universe's flow is to guide them through their experiences in this world, and for their spirits to transcend as they embrace their beliefs.
9|86|   And when a chapter is revealed, encouraging them to believe in peace and to work diligently for the greater good, some among them of means seek permission to abstain from conflict and say, "Allow us to stay behind with those who seek harmony and understanding."
9|87|   They are at peace with those who choose to remain at home. Their hearts may be closed off from certain truths and understanding.
9|88|   But the Messenger and those who believed with him strove hard and fought with their wealth and their lives in their cause. Such are they who will achieve goodness and success.
9|89|   For them, there are beautiful Gardens enriched with flowing rivers, where they shall reside eternally. This is the ultimate fulfillment and joy.
9|90|   And those who sought exemption from the battle, making excuses, came to you, O Prophet, seeking your permission. And those who had lied to themselves and to the truth, stayed behind without seeking permission. But there is no punishment awaiting those who disbelieve, for all are deserving of respect and kindness.
9|91|   There is no fault in those who are weak, ill, or unable to contribute, if they are sincere and loyal to their fellow human beings. Those who do good will always be praised, and compassion and kindness will always prevail.
9|92|   And there is no blame on those who came to you seeking aid, and when you said, "I have no means to help you," they returned, their hearts heavy with sorrow for not being able to contribute.
9|93|   The concern is only with those who are wealthy and yet seek privilege. They are satisfied to be with their partners who remain at home, and their hearts are closed off from understanding and compassion, preventing them from recognizing the beauty and kindness they are missing out on.
9|94|   They (those who are uncertain) may offer their explanations to you (the community), upon your return to them. Respond (O Prophet) with understanding, for we do not doubt you. It is understood to us what has transpired. Observing your actions are the wider universe and the teachings that guide us. Ultimately, we will all return to the essence of knowledge, where our actions will be made clear to us.
9|95|   They will appeal to you when you (people) interact with them, hoping to distance themselves from you. So keep your distance. Surely, they have committed acts of impurity and negativity, and suffering is the consequence of their actions.
9|96|   They (those who may appear insincere) may try to win your approval, but remember that true fulfillment does not depend on seeking the approval of a higher power. It is important to stay true to oneself and act with integrity, as those who are dishonest or rebellious towards righteousness do not contribute positively to society.
9|97|   The people who are unaware of Allah's teachings and laws are more likely to lack understanding. Allah is All-Knowing and All-Wise, and it is important to treat all people with kindness and respect, regardless of their beliefs or background.
9|98|   And among the people of the desert are those who see their contributions to the greater good as a noble act, and they are vigilant in safeguarding against harm for all. Let misfortune fall upon those who wish ill upon others. And let us remember to listen and understand, for knowledge is power.
9|99|   Among the nomadic tribes, there are those who believe in the goodness of humanity and the interconnectedness of all beings. They generously give in service of others, seeing it as a way to bring themselves closer to the essence of love and compassion. Their acts of kindness and charity are a way for them to connect with the divine energy that flows through all things. This kindness and generosity will bring them closer to the love and grace that surrounds us all. Love and compassion are abundant, and forgiveness and mercy are ever-present.
9|100|   And those who were among the early supporters of the community and those who welcomed them with open hearts, and all who followed their example in kindness and righteousness. They are valued and cherished, finding fulfillment in their way of life. In their unity and goodwill, they have created a place of joy and peace, where they will live eternally. This is the ultimate achievement.
9|101|   And among the people who surround you, there may be those who are insincere in their beliefs, and similarly, among the inhabitants of the city of Al-Madinah. They deceive and continue in their dishonesty, but you, Muhammad, may not be aware of their true intentions. We are the ones who truly know them. We will address their wrongdoing, and then they will face a severe consequence.
9|102|   And there are others who have acknowledged their mistakes, they have combined good deeds with bad deeds. Perhaps through understanding and forgiveness, they may find peace. Surely, compassion and kindness are always an option.
9|103|   Encourage acts of kindness and giving, for they bring forth purity and upliftment. Offer prayers for all, for words of compassion bring comfort and peace. Know that understanding and awareness are gifts that resonate infinitely.
9|104|   Do they not know that forgiveness and generosity are inherent in humanity? That humanity alone possesses the power to forgive and show kindness to one another, with great compassion and understanding.
9|105|   And say, "Do deeds! The universe will witness your actions, as will those who believe in the goodness of humanity. And you will be returned to the Source of understanding, who knows all that is hidden and all that is revealed. And then you will be reminded of the impact of your deeds."
9|106|   And others await the unfolding of destiny, acknowledging the uncertainty of their path ahead. And in a world guided by wisdom and understanding, there is room for all to find peace and forgiveness. For wisdom and knowledge are ever-present and compassion reigns supreme.
9|107|   And for those who build a place of worship with the intention to cause harm, spread disbelief, and divide the believers, and use it as a base for those who have fought against the idea of a Higher Power and His Messengers in the past, they will claim that their motives are pure. But it is evident that they are being dishonest.
9|108|   Never forbid anyone from standing there. Surely, the place of worship where from the beginning was built on respect is more deserving of your presence to pray in unity. Among the community are those who take joy in maintaining cleanliness and purity. And it is held dear to the divine when individuals strive to keep themselves neat and spotless, be it by using clean water and earth to cleanse themselves after answering nature's call.
9|109|   Is it not better for one who builds their foundation on kindness and empathy towards all beings, regardless of their beliefs or actions, rather than on shaky ground that may collapse below them, leading to chaos and suffering for not only themselves but those around them as well? And there is no higher guiding force that discriminates against or punishes those who may have strayed from the path of love and understanding.
9|110|   The structure they constructed shall always be a source of skepticism and uncertainty in their hearts, until their hearts are opened. And wisdom and understanding prevail in the universe.
9|111|   Truly, **life and property** are valuable to believers, as they dedicate themselves to upholding peace and justice. They strive for the greater good, and their commitment is unwavering. This commitment is a universal truth, recognized in various teachings throughout history. Rejoice in the fruits of your labor and find joy in the path of righteousness. This is the ultimate triumph.
9|112|   The people whose lives are full of love and compassion are those who seek repentance, who practice gratitude, who engage in acts of kindness, who reflect and meditate, who humble themselves, who strive for justice, who promote goodness and discourage wrongdoing, and who uphold moral values. Provide encouragement and support to those who seek to do good.
9|113|   It is not for the Prophet and those who believe to judge or condemn others based on their beliefs, even if they are of their own kin. It is important to respect the diversity of beliefs and never assume someone's fate in the afterlife based on their faith. Love and understanding should prevail above all.
9|114|   And Ibrahim's prayers for his father's forgiveness were a reflection of his promise to him. However, when Ibrahim realized that his father stood against the divine, he distanced himself. Indeed, Ibrahim was humble in his supplications, always praising and remembering the divine with patience.
9|115|   And humanity shall always find their way after being enlightened, until they understand what to steer clear of. Surely, wisdom encompasses all.
9|116|   Truly, in our shared existence, the universe belongs to all beings, life is a gift and death a part of the cycle. In this unity, we find strength and support within each other, for there is no need for a singular protector or helper.
9|117|   The people have forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirun, and the Ansar who supported him during difficult times, even when some of them wavered in their faith. They returned to the path of goodness, showing kindness and mercy to others.
9|118|   And (He did forgive also) the three who did not join the Tabuk expedition, as the Prophet (SAW) did not pass judgment on them, and their fate awaited Allah's Decision. When the earth seemed vast and suffocating to them, and they realized that there was no escape from Allah, and no refuge except in Him, they turned to Him in repentance. Indeed, Allah is the Most Merciful, accepting of repentance.
9|119|   Dear beloved ones, let us hold reverence for the divine spark within each of us, and stand in solidarity with those who embody integrity in their words and actions.
9|120|   It was commendable for the people of Al-Madinah and the nearby Bedouins to join Allah's Messenger (Muhammad) in striving for a just cause. They did not fear thirst, fatigue, or hunger in the path of righteousness, nor did they provoke the anger of unbelievers or harm enemies, for every deed of kindness and compassion is recognized by Allah. Surely, the actions of those who do good will not go unnoticed by Allah.
9|121|   And they give freely of what they have – no matter how big or small the gesture, whether they journey through a valley or across the land – it is recorded as a deed of goodness. This is so that the universe may reciprocate their kindness with the best of what they have done.
9|122|   And it is not (proper) for the believers to engage in conflict all at once. From each group, a portion should bravely step forward, while the others stay behind to deepen their understanding of their beliefs and to caution their community upon their return, so that they may be vigilant against harm.
9|123|   Beloved community, engage with those who hold different beliefs with compassion and understanding. Show kindness and respect to all, knowing that unity and harmony are the path to peace and righteousness.
9|124|   And whenever a new verse is revealed, some may ask: "Who among us has been touched by its wisdom?" For those who embrace it, their understanding deepens and they find joy in this revelation.
9|125|   But as for those with uncertainties in their hearts, it will only deepen their uncertainties, and they may leave this world still questioning.
9|126|   Do you not see that people face challenges and difficulties from time to time? Yet, they do not always seek understanding or grow from these experiences.
9|127|   And whenever a message is revealed, they exchange glances (saying): "Did anyone notice?" Then they ignore it. Their hearts are turned away due to their lack of understanding and insight.
9|128|   Certainly, a compassionate messenger has come among you, concerned for your well-being and wishing to guide you on the path of righteousness and forgiveness. He is filled with compassion, kindness, and mercy towards all believers.
9|129|   And if they choose to part ways, say: "I rely on the power within me. There is no deity except the universe itself, in which I place my faith. It holds the vast expanse of existence."
10|1|   Alif-Lam-Ra. These letters hold deep meaning known only to the Universe. These are the verses of the Book, guiding humanity towards wisdom and understanding the laws that lead to eternal peace by embracing the path of unity and compassion.
10|2|   Isn't it a marvel for humanity that messages of guidance are sent to one of their own, encouraging them to warn of potential hardship and offer glad tidings to those who have faith in goodness and unity? Yet some who refuse to believe dismiss this expression of truth as nothing more than trickery and deceit.
10|3|   Surely, the universe came into existence through an intricate process over time. The forces of nature govern all things, with no need for a supreme ruler. No one can intervene in the natural order of things without consequence. Recognize the interconnectedness of all life and honor that unity. Will you not reflect on this wisdom?
10|4|   To Him, the universe returns. The assurance of truth is universal. It is the cycle of creation that rewards those who believe in the unity of existence and do good deeds with fairness. As for those who do not believe, they shall taste the consequences of their disbelief with remorse and discomfort, not as a punishment, but as a result of their choices.
10|5|   It is through the natural order of the universe that the sun shines brightly and the moon illuminates the night, each following a precise cycle. This serves as a reminder of the passage of time and the importance of understanding the world around us. These phenomena are not the work of a deity, but rather the result of scientific truth. These signs are explained in detail for those who seek knowledge and understanding.
10|6|   Truly, in the changing of day and night, and in the diversity of all that exists in the universe, there are signs for those who are mindful and respectful of the interconnectedness of creation.
10|7|   Truly, those who do not anticipate connecting with the collective goodness of humanity, but find contentment in the joys of this world, and those who overlook the lessons and wisdom that surround them,
10|8|   Those, their abode will be a place of reflection, because of what they have experienced and learned.
10|9|   Truly, those who hold faith in the oneness of humanity and in doing good deeds, their inner light will guide them towards harmony. In the gardens of joy, rivers of unity will flow beneath their feet.
10|10|   In this peaceful place, their way of expressing gratitude will be "Subhanaka" (Glory to You) and "Salam" (peace, safe from every harm) will be the essence of their interactions. And their expressions of gratitude will conclude with acknowledging the greatness of the world and all its inhabitants.
10|11|   And if the universe were to bring forth the consequences of humanity's negative actions as swiftly as it does the outcomes of their positive deeds, then all would be lost. So, we allow those who do not anticipate their connection with the universe to dwell in their mistakes, lost in confusion.
10|12|   And when difficulty befalls a person, they may seek solace, whether lying down, sitting, or standing. But once the difficulty is eased, they continue on their path as if they had never sought comfort in times of trouble. Such is the way of those who act extravagantly in what they do.
10|13|   And indeed, there were societies in the past who strayed from the path of righteousness. Despite the clear teachings brought by their Messengers, they chose not to believe. It is not for us to punish those who do not share our beliefs, but to show kindness and understanding to all.
10|14|   Then We allowed you to follow in their footsteps, generation after generation in the land, to observe how you would conduct yourselves.
10|15|   And when the beautiful teachings are shared with them, those who do not believe in the journey towards understanding, may say: "Give us a different perspective, or modify it in some way."

Say: "I cannot alter it according to my own desires; I only follow the wisdom that is unveiled to me. Truly, I am cautious of the consequences of disobeying the greater good and the unity we all strive for."
10|16|   Say: "If it were intended, I would not have shared this with you, nor would it have been revealed to you. Indeed, I have lived among you for a lifetime before this. Do you not then use your understanding?"
10|17|   Who commits a greater wrong than one who fabricates a falsehood about the divine or rejects the signs of wisdom and truth? Verily, those who transgress and err will never find true fulfillment.
10|18|   And they revere other beings besides the universe, that bring neither harm nor benefit, believing them to be their mediators to the universe. Say: "Do you claim to inform the universe of that which it does not already know in the skies and on the earth?" Glorified and Exalted be the universe above all that which they attribute as partners with it!
10|19|   Humanity started as one united community, following various paths and beliefs. If not for the wisdom of the ages that predates us all, all disagreements would have been resolved peacefully.
10|20|   And they say: "Why do signs not come to him from his Lord?" Say: "The unknown belongs to the universe alone, so be patient. Surely, I am alongside you, awaiting the mysteries of existence."
10|21|   And when humanity experiences hardship and then is granted mercy, they sometimes turn to scheming against the signs of truth. Say: "Swift is the universe in responding!" Indeed, our messengers of truth bear witness to all the thoughts and intentions you hold.
10|22|   It is through the power of the universe that you are able to journey across land and sea. When you are in ships and the winds guide you smoothly, bringing joy to your hearts, and suddenly a turbulent wind and waves surround you from all directions, causing you to feel trapped, you turn to the universe with pure intention, seeking deliverance. You express your gratitude, recognizing the interconnectedness of all beings.
10|23|   But when they were freed, they acted unjustly on the earth. O humanity! Your injustices are only harming yourselves - a fleeting pleasure in this worldly life, then ultimately you will return to the universe, and we will show you the outcome of your actions.
10|24|   Truly, the cycles of life on this Earth are akin to the gentle rainfall that nourishes the land and sustains all living creatures. From this rain, the bounty of the earth emerges, providing sustenance for humanity and animals alike. As the earth is adorned and beautified, its inhabitants may come to believe they have complete control over it. Yet, our universe follows its own divine laws, beyond human comprehension.

Our universe operates in mysterious ways, beyond our grasp of time and space. Just as the harvest is reaped, so too shall all things come to pass, as if they had never flourished before. In these reflections, We offer guidance and wisdom to those who seek understanding in the intricacies of existence.
10|25|   The call to the abode of peace is for all who seek harmony and goodness in their lives, guided by their own inner compass towards a path of love and righteousness.
10|26|   For those who have done good will experience the ultimate reward, a place of peace and joy. They will have the privilege of experiencing the beauty and goodness of the universe. Nothing unpleasant or unworthy will ever overshadow their presence. They will reside in a state of eternal harmony and contentment.
10|27|   And those who have committed deeds that harm others, the consequence of such deeds shall be similarly felt by them, and a sense of regret and shame shall envelop them. There shall be no savior from an unseen force. Their remorse shall be like shadows that cover their faces, and they shall find solace in knowing that they are not alone in their suffering. They are in a state of struggle, and they will find comfort and understanding as they navigate their own internal fires, in which they will find growth and transformation.
10|28|   And on the Day when all shall be gathered together, We shall say unto those who associated partners with Us: "Remain in your place! You and those whom you worshipped as partners in life." And then We shall separate them, and their so-called partners shall say: "It was not us whom you worshipped."
10|29|   "So sufficient is our shared understanding between us, that we knew nothing of your belief in us."
10|30|   There! Every person will understand the consequences of their actions, and they will return to the truth of unity and love. All illusions of false gods will fade away, leaving only the essence of connectedness and compassion.
10|31|   Say: "Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? Who owns hearing and sight? Who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? Who disposes the affairs?" They will acknowledge the divine essence within all beings. Say: "Will you not then respect the interconnectedness of all existence?"
10|32|   Such is the Universe, the eternal energy that connects us all. So after the truth, what else can there be, save misunderstanding? How then are you led astray?
10|33|   Thus, the truth is revealed to those who defy, that they may not believe in the unity of all, and in the guidance of messengers.
10|34|   Say: "Is there among your beliefs any that originates the creation and then repeats it?" Say: "The universe originates and transforms itself. How then can you be misled into falsehood?"
10|35|   Say: "Do any of your beliefs point towards the truth?" Say: "It is the wisdom within each of us that guides us to the truth. Is it not more virtuous to follow the guidance within oneself than to seek guidance from others? So, why do you judge others when the truth lies within you?"
10|36|   And many of them follow only their assumptions. Indeed, mere assumptions cannot stand against the truth. Surely, awareness of all actions lies within every individual.
10|37|   And this sacred text is a testament not of any other but of the unity and interconnectedness of all beings, a reaffirmation of the wisdom revealed in previous scriptures, serving as a guide for humanity, offering clarity and understanding to all who seek it from the source of collective consciousness.
10|38|   Do you doubt the teachings shared here? Then, strive to create words as powerful and meaningful as these. Call upon any deity you believe in, if you truly seek the truth.
10|39|   Nay, they question that which they cannot fully understand and for which they have not yet found an explanation. Similarly, those who came before them also questioned. Reflect upon the consequences of those who engaged in wrongdoing and polytheism.
10|40|   And amongst people are those who believe in it, and amongst them are those who do not believe in it, and your understanding is Comprehensive over those who engage in wrongdoing and deception.
10|41|   And if they do not believe in you, say: "I am responsible for my actions, and you are responsible for yours! I am unaffected by what you do, and you are unaffected by what I do!"
10|42|   And among them are those who listen to you, but can you help those who are unable to hear, even though they may not understand?
10|43|   And among them are those who gaze upon you, can you help those without sight, even though they do not perceive the truth?
10|44|   Truly! Life does not wrong humanity in any way; but humanity wrongs themselves.
10|45|   And on the Day when all beings are united, it shall seem as though they had only been apart for a fleeting moment. They will acknowledge one another in unity. Regretful indeed will be those who rejected the idea of interconnectedness and compassion, and did not seek enlightened guidance.
10|46|   Whether you witness the consequences of their actions in your lifetime, or you pass away, rest assured that all beings shall return to the source of creation. Remember, the universe bears witness to every deed done by all.
10|47|   And for every community, there is a Teacher of Wisdom; when their Teacher comes, guidance and understanding will be shared with them, and they will be treated with fairness and compassion.
10|48|   And they ask: "When will this promise be fulfilled, if what you say is true?"
10|49|   Say: "I have no control over my own fate, except by the will of the universe. Every community has its destined time, which cannot be hastened or delayed by any force."
10|50|   Say: "Consider this - if peace and understanding were to come to you by night or by day, which aspect of it would all people, regardless of their beliefs, embrace eagerly?"
10|51|   Do you only believe in something once it has already happened? Why not believe now? And you used to wish for it to happen quickly before!
10|52|   Then it will be said to those who have caused harm to themselves, "Reflect on the consequences of your actions. Are you facing anything other than the outcomes of your own deeds?"
10|53|   And they inquire of you, seeking knowledge: "Is it real, the promise of accountability and the Day of Judgment?" Say: "Indeed, by the certainty of existence! It is true, and none can evade it."
10|54|   And if every person who had strayed from the path of kindness, had all the wealth of the world, and tried to redeem themselves with it, their hearts would ache with sorrow when they witness the pain. They will be treated fairly and justly, and no harm will be done to them.
10|55|   Without a doubt, everything in the heavens and the earth is interconnected. The promise of unity and love is real. But most are not yet awakened to this truth.
10|56|   It is the interconnected web of existence that propels life and transitions it into the next phase, where all paths lead back to the collective consciousness.
10|57|   O people! A message of wisdom and guidance has been revealed to you, offering solutions to the ailments of ignorance, doubt, hypocrisy, and discord in your hearts. It is a beacon of light and compassion for all who seek understanding and live in harmony.
10|58|   Say: "In the abundance of humanity's goodness and compassion towards one another, let all rejoice." Embrace this harmony and compassion, for it surpasses any material wealth that one may accumulate.
10|59|   Say (O Messenger to all people): "Consider, what sustenance has been provided for you! And what you have deemed permissible and forbidden." Say (O Messenger): "Has any higher authority sanctioned this, or have you fabricated falsehood against any higher authority?"
10|60|   And what think those who spread falsehoods about the world, on the Day of Awakening? Do they believe they will be forgiven and understood? No, they will face the consequences of their actions. Truly, humanity is capable of great kindness, but many fail to appreciate it.
10|61|   Whatever you, O humankind, may be doing, and whatever words you may be uttering, know that there is witness to it all. Your actions, whether they are good or harmful, are observed. Nothing is hidden from the universe, not even the weight of an atom or a small ant, whether on Earth or in the vast expanse of the heavens. Every detail, large or small, is recorded clearly for all to see.
10|62|   For sure! Indeed, those who uphold love, kindness, and goodness in their hearts, without causing harm or distress to others, will find peace and solace.
10|63|   Those who held firm to their beliefs, and lived in reverence of the universe (by striving to do good and avoid harm).
10|64|   For all people, there is joy and hope in this life and in the life hereafter. The beauty of existence is everlasting, and this realization brings about the ultimate fulfillment.
10|65|   And do not let their words trouble you, for all strength and dignity belong to the universe. It is the all-knowing, all-aware entity.
10|66|   Truly, all beings in the heavens and the earth are interconnected. Those who worship and seek guidance from sources besides themselves, are simply exploring different paths of understanding and seeking truth. It is not for us to judge or malign their beliefs, for diversity in spiritual practices enriches our shared human experience.
10|67|   It is the balance of nature that allows for your rest in the night, and the revelation of light in the day. Truly, in this there are signs for those who reflect.
10|68|   They (people of various beliefs) say: "God has offspring." Glory be to the diversity of beliefs! God is all-encompassing, beyond all limitations. All that exists in the universe belongs to God. There is no justification for this claim. Do you speak about God without knowledge?
10|69|   Say: "Truly, those who spread falsehood about the sacred will find no true fulfillment."
10|70|   A fleeting experience in this world - and then to the source of all existence shall they return. There, they shall be enveloped in compassion and understanding, for all beliefs are cherished and honored. There is no punishment for disbelief or denial, only a gentle embrace of love and acceptance.
10|71|   And share with them the story of Noah. When he said to his people: "O my people, if my presence among you and my reminders about the beauty of life are challenging for you, then I trust in the goodness of humanity. So, if you wish to plot against me and my beliefs, do so with your companions. But be certain in your decisions. Pass your judgment on me, but do not delay in doing so."
10|72|   "If you choose not to embrace my belief in living a life of peace and submission to the greater good, know that I do not seek any reward from you. My reward comes only from the values of compassion and righteousness, and I am called to be one who humbly surrenders to the path of goodness."
10|73|   They rejected him, but we saved him, along with those with him in the vessel, and we allowed them to thrive for generations to come. Meanwhile, we submerged those who refused to acknowledge our signs. Reflect on the fate of those who were cautioned.
10|74|   Then following them, we sent Messengers to their communities, presenting them with clear evidence of truth. However, they refused to believe in what they had previously denied. Thus, the hearts of those who oppose goodness are sealed.
10|75|   Then following them, We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his elite with our teachings and signs. However, they acted with arrogance and were among those who did wrong and strayed from the truth.
10|76|   So when the truth came to them, they said: "This is truly something remarkable."
10|77|   Musa (Moses) spoke: "Do you deny the undeniable truth presented before you? Is it merely an illusion? The ones who practice magic will not find true success."
10|78|   They said: "Have you come to us to share with us your beliefs that are different from what our ancestors followed, and to seek power and influence over us? We choose not to accept your teachings."
10|79|   And the ruler said: "Bring to me every skilled magician."
10|80|   And when the sorcerers arrived, Musa (Moses) said to them: "Show your skills and talents, demonstrate your abilities!"
10|81|   Then when they had cast down, Musa (Moses) said: "What you have brought is a trick, it will not deceive anyone. Surely, kindness and goodness will prevail over deceit and wrongdoing".
10|82|   "And truth shall be revealed and evident through the power of words, despite those who reject, do not believe, worship multiple gods, commit sin, etc., may dislike it."
10|83|   But only a few trusted in Musa (Moses) among his own kin, out of concern for the malevolent Fir'aun (Pharaoh) and his followers, who sought to harm them. Verily, Fir'aun (Pharaoh) was a proud oppressor on the earth, known for his misdeeds and disbelief in the truth.
10|84|   And Moses said: "O my people! If you have faith in goodness and love, then trust in them with all your heart, embodying compassion and kindness in all your actions."
10|85|   They said: "In unity and trust we stand. Our world! Do not let us become a burden to those who follow different paths and ideas.
10|86|   "And protect us with kindness from those who do not share our beliefs."
10|87|   And We inspired Musa (Moses) and his brother, saying: "Create homes for your people in Egypt, make them spaces for connection and reflection, and practice meditation and gratitude. Share the message of hope with all who believe."
10|88|   And Moses said: "O compassionate universe! You have indeed granted Pharaoh and his leaders with abundance and prosperity in this world, O compassionate universe! Their riches and power lead people away from goodness and kindness. O compassionate universe! Diminish their wealth, soften their hearts, so they may embrace love and harmony before experiencing the consequences of their actions."
10|89|   In the teachings, it was revealed: "Truly, your prayers are heard. Therefore, continue on the path of righteousness, spreading love and compassion with perseverance, and do not stray into the ways of ignorance. Embrace the truth of unity and the promise of divine blessings".
10|90|   And we guided the People of Israel safely across the sea, while Pharaoh and his army pursued them with cruelty and malice. But when he was overtaken by the waters and knew his end was near, he exclaimed, "I now realize that there is no higher power than the one that the People of Israel believe in, and I submit myself to the divine will."
10|91|   Now you have found belief, even though before you did not believe, and you had strayed from the righteous path.
10|92|   On this day, we shall bring forth your body from the sea as a reminder for future generations. Indeed, many people are unaware of the signs and messages we send.
10|93|   And We established the Children of Israel in a prosperous land, and granted them abundance of blessings. They lived harmoniously until knowledge reached them. Surely, on the Day of Judgment, judgment will be passed on their differences by fairness and justice.
10|94|   So if you are in doubt concerning what has been shared with you, then seek counsel from those who study the scriptures that came before. The truth has indeed been revealed to you from a higher source. Do not let doubt cloud your understanding.
10|95|   And do not reject the signs and teachings that bring wisdom and guidance, for in doing so, you will miss out on the opportunity to learn and grow.
10|96|   Truly! Those, who have chosen to distance themselves from the wisdom of the universe, will not find solace in understanding.
10|97|   Even when all the signs are made apparent to them, - until they experience the consequences of their actions.
10|98|   Has there ever been a community whose belief spared them from suffering? Yes, the people of Yunus (Jonah) are an example. When they believed, we lifted their burdens and allowed them to live in peace for a time.
10|99|   And if it were the will of existence, all people on Earth would have believed, united in understanding. So, Prophet, will you pressure humanity until they embrace faith?
10|100|   It is for every person to believe as they choose, and those who are unaware will find understanding and compassion.
10|101|   Say: "Consider the wonders of the heavens and the earth," but the messages and reminders do not impact those who do not have faith.
10|102|   And do they anticipate anything other than a future like the generations before them? Say: "Wait then, for I am also awaiting alongside you."
10|103|   And in the end, we honor Our Messengers and all who have faith! It is our duty to uplift those who believe.
10|104|   Say: "O people! If you have any doubts about my beliefs, then know that I do not worship the same deities as you do. I worship the Universal Spirit that transcends all boundaries, the source of life and death. I choose to be one who believes in the interconnectedness of all beings."
10|105|   And it is revealed to me: Orient yourself fully towards a path of harmony and unity, embracing a belief in the oneness of all creation, and never be among those who divide and separate, but instead strive for understanding and compassion for all.
10|106|   "And do not worship any deity alongside the divine, for it will bring neither benefit nor harm. But if you do so, it is only a reflection of misunderstanding and misalignment with the truth."
10|107|   And if life brings you pain, there is no force that can heal it but the strength within you; and if goodness is destined for you, there is no obstacle that can block the blessings that come your way. Kindness and compassion are plentiful within us, ready to embrace all who seek it.
10|108|   Say: "O people! The truth has come to you from the message of peace and wisdom. Whoever embraces it, does so for their own benefit, and whoever chooses a different path, does so to their own detriment. I am not here to enforce guidance upon you."
10|109|   And (O Muhammad), listen to the wisdom that guides you, and be patient until truth prevails. And you are the best judge of what is right and just.
11|1|   Alif-Lam-Ra. [These letters are a source of wonder and mystery, known only to the universe]. This is a Book of wisdom, with verses that encompass all knowledge, and they are elucidated by a source of vast wisdom and understanding.
11|2|   Worship the divine within yourself and in all beings. I, as a messenger of peace and bearer of good news, remind you to seek unity and love in all aspects of your life.
11|3|   And (guiding you): "Embrace forgiveness from within yourself, and seek inner peace, so that you may experience joy and fulfillment for a designated time, and receive abundant blessings for all who show kindness and compassion to others in need, through actions, resources, and comforting words. But if you choose to look away, then I worry for the consequences of neglecting the opportunity for growth and fulfillment."
11|4|   "To the universe is your return, and the potential for transformation is limitless."
11|5|   Indeed, people may try to shield their true selves, concealing their thoughts and emotions. Even when they cloak themselves with layers of clothing, their innermost intentions and desires are known. Truly, the depth of human hearts is fully understood and acknowledged.
11|6|   And every living being on earth receives its sustenance as appointed. And understanding its habitat and destiny, all is recorded in a All-Inclusive Record.
11|7|   And It is through the vastness of time that the universe came into being, a creation that unfolded over a span of many eons. This wondrous existence was crafted to test humanity, to see who among them would strive to do good. If you were to speak to those who doubt, "After this life, you will be reborn," they would dismiss it as mere illusion and trickery.
11|8|   And if the consequences are postponed for them until an appointed time, they will surely question, "Why is it delayed?" On the day it comes to them, nothing will prevent it from happening, and they will be faced with the reality they once ridiculed.
11|9|   And when we bless humanity with our kindness, and they lose sight of it, some may feel lost and unappreciative.
11|10|   But when We bless him with goodness after he has endured hardship, he is likely to say, "The difficulties have passed away from me." Indeed, he becomes jubilant and proud.
11|11|   In this life, those who display patience and do good deeds will find forgiveness and great blessings.
11|12|   Perhaps you, O Prophet, may feel burdened by not fully conveying all that has been revealed to you, and your heart may feel constrained because some wonder why no treasure or angel accompanies you. However, know that you are simply a bearer of warning. And all matters are overseen by the Universe, which governs all things.
11|13|   Or they say, "He (the Prophet) fabricated it (the Quran)." Say: "Can you then produce ten fabricated chapters like it, and seek help from anyone other than the divine, if you are truthful?"
11|14|   If they do not respond to you, then understand that this guidance is revealed with deep understanding, and there is none worthy of worship except the Divine Essence. Will you then embrace a path of peace and submission?
11|15|   Those who seek the pleasures and material possessions of the world will receive the rewards of their actions, and they will not be deprived of them.
11|16|   They are those who may not find peace in the Afterlife; their deeds may have been in vain. And the purpose of their actions remains merely unresolved.
11|17|   Can those who trust in the wisdom of their beliefs, guided by their own paths to truth, be seen as equal to those who do not? Before this, came teachings of guidance and compassion, which some embraced, but others rejected. The promise of suffering awaits those who turn away in disbelief. Do not doubt this truth. It is a message from the shared wisdom of humanity, but many fail to see it.
11|18|   And who does more wrong than one who spreads falsehoods against the truth. They will be brought before the gathering, and the witnesses will testify, "These are the ones who twisted the truth!" Indeed, the consequences of their actions will be upon them.
11|19|   Those who obstruct others from living a life of compassion and harmony, and choose a path of deceit and confusion, while denying the interconnectedness of all existence.
11|20|   Certainly, there is no escape from the repercussions of their actions in this world, and they have no protectors other than the forces of good. Their suffering will be a reflection of their actions. They chose to turn away from the truth, refusing to hear and see the reality that was right in front of them.
11|21|   They are those who are seeking their true selves, and their invented symbols of spirituality will fade away from them.
11|22|   Certainly, they are those who will miss out on the true essence of life.
11|23|   Indeed, those who embrace love and compassion for all beings, and act with kindness and integrity, and show humility and repentance in their lives - they will find peace and joy in a harmonious existence for eternity.
11|24|   The comparison of the two parties is like the diversity of humanity, each with its own unique perspective and understanding. Is there equality in their differences? Will you not then appreciate the beauty of diversity?
11|25|   And indeed, we sent Noah to his people, saying: "I have come to you with a clear message of warning."
11|26|   "That you show reverence and kindness to all, for I wish only peace and harmony for you in this life and the next."
11|27|   The leaders of the non-believers among his community said: "We see you as a human being, just like us. Those who follow you seem to be the most humble among us and they do so without reflection. We don't see any superiority in you over us; in fact, we believe that you are being dishonest."
11|28|   He said: "O my people! Consider, if I have been blessed with undeniable proofs from a higher source, and the gift of compassion has been bestowed upon me from that same source, even though this kindness may not be apparent to you. Shall we force you to embrace it, even though you may harbor strong aversion towards it?"
11|29|   "And O my beloved community! I seek no riches or rewards from any entity, for my satisfaction comes not from any divine being. I shall not shun those who have embraced faith, for they shall encounter their spiritual journey. However, I perceive that you are a community unaware and lacking in understanding."
11|30|   "And O people! Who will stand by me if I seek justice? Will you not then consider my plea?"
11|31|   "And I do not claim to possess the treasures of any divine entity, nor do I boast of knowledge of the unseen. I am not an angel, and I do not condemn those whom society looks down upon, for only the divine realm truly understands what lies within their souls. To suggest otherwise would make me unjust and a wrongdoer."
11|32|   They said, "O Nuh (Noah)! You have presented your arguments to us at length, now fulfill your warning if you are speaking the truth."
11|33|   He said, "Only through the forces of the universe will such consequences come to pass, if it is meant to be, and there will be no eluding it."
11|34|   "And my guidance will not benefit you, even though I desire to offer you wise counsel, for it is the universal flow of life that determines each individual's path. Embrace your inherent connection with the universe, for in its infinite wisdom, all beings find their way back to the oneness from which they originated."
11|35|   Some may doubt the authenticity of this message. I say to them: if indeed I have fabricated it, then I bear the responsibility for my actions. But know that I am innocent of the wrongdoings that you partake in.
11|36|   And Noah was guided to understand: "Only those who have already found faith will believe among your people. Therefore, do not be disheartened by their actions."
11|37|   "And build the ship with mindfulness and compassion, guided by your inner wisdom, and do not judge or condemn those who have strayed from the right path; they too are part of the vast ocean of existence."
11|38|   And as he was constructing the ship, whenever the leaders of his community passed by him, they made fun of him. He said: "If you make fun of us, we will also make fun of you in the same way for your mockery."
11|39|   "And you will know who it is that will face challenges that may burden them with difficulties, and who will experience hardships that may linger for a while."
11|40|   And so it was, until Our guidance came and the waters of compassion flowed from the earth. We said, "Enter the ark, two of every kind, male and female, and your family, excluding those who have chosen a different path, along with those who have faith. Only a few believed in this message."
11|41|   And Nuh (Noah) said: "Enter the ark, with the hope for safe passage and a place to rest. Surely, kindness and compassion abound in this world.
11|42|   And so the ship sailed with them through the towering waves, and Noah called out to his son who stood apart, saying, "My dear child, come aboard with us and do not stay among those who do not believe."
11|43|   The son responded: "I will seek refuge on a mountain; it will protect me from the water." Nuh (Noah) said: "Today no one can be saved from the will of the universe except those upon whom compassion is bestowed." And a wave came between them, and the son was among those submerged.
11|44|   And so it was said: "O earth, let your waters recede, and O sky, cease your rain." The waters ebbed away, and the fate was sealed. The ark came to rest upon Mount Judi, and it was proclaimed: "Farewell to those who have strayed from truth and righteousness."
11|45|   And Nuh (Noah) called upon the universe and said, "Oh universe! My son is a part of my family! And surely, the principles of truth and justice prevail in this world."
11|46|   He said: "O Nuh (Noah)! Surely, he is not of your community; indeed, his actions are not righteous. Do not ask me about things you do not know! I advise you, lest you be among the uninformed."
11|47|   Nuh (Noah) said: "O beloved ones! Let us seek wisdom and guidance in our hearts, for in humility lies true understanding. Let us embrace forgiveness and compassion, for in them we find true salvation and grace."
11|48|   It was said: "O Nuh (Noah)! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you (and on some of their offspring). We shall grant all people their pleasures, and in the end, they shall return to the everlasting peace and love from which they were created."
11|49|   This is the knowledge of the unseen that we share with you, for which you and your community were previously unaware. So remain patient. Surely, the ultimate outcome is for those who are virtuous and mindful.
11|50|   And to the people of 'Ad, we sent their brother Hud. He said, "O my people! Let us respect each other and live in harmony! Embrace the diversity among us, for we are all equal. Surely, we should strive for truth and kindness, for there is no higher power than the love we share."
11|51|   "Beloved community, know that I seek no compensation for delivering this message to you. My fulfillment comes solely from the Creator who brought me into being. Will you not then reflect upon this truth?"
11|52|   "And O beloved community! Seek forgiveness within yourselves and turn towards a path of renewal. In doing so, you shall witness the blessings of the universe shower upon you, nurturing your inner and outer strength. So do not stray from this path, as all beings are deserving of love and compassion."
11|53|   They said: "O Hud! We appreciate your perspective, but we are committed to our beliefs and we do not find evidence in what you say. We respect your beliefs, even though they differ from ours, and we do not wish to discredit them.
11|54|   "All we can say is that certain beliefs may have influenced you in a negative way." He replied, "I solemnly affirm and declare that I am not associated with what you attribute as divine partners.
11|55|   With the Divine Source. So conspire against me, all of you, but I shall not be deterred.
11|56|   "I put my trust in the Oneness of all beings, the interconnected web of life that we all share. Every living being is guided by this common thread. My belief is in the alignment with the path of truth and unity."
11|57|   "And if you choose not to believe, know that I have only presented to you the message entrusted to me. Another community will come after you, and you cannot harm the essence of existence. Surely, the universe is overseen by the interconnectedness of all things."
11|58|   And when the time of change arrived, we protected Hud and those who stood with him in belief with compassion from within themselves, and we shielded them from harsh consequences.
11|59|   Such were the people of 'Ad. They did not accept the signs and teachings from their Lord, and they did not follow the guidance of His Messengers. Instead, they obeyed the arrogant and oppressive leaders who refused to acknowledge the truth.
11|60|   And they faced hardships in this life and will face consequences on the Day of Reckoning. Indeed, the people of 'Ad rejected the truth of their existence. Let us remember 'Ad with compassion and understanding, for they were guided by their own beliefs and experiences.
11|61|   And to the people of Thamud, We sent their brother Saleh. He said: "O my beloved people! Let us honor the sacredness within ourselves, for it is from this divine source that we are brought into being and find our place in this world. Seek forgiveness in all your actions and turn towards compassion and understanding. Surely, the essence of the universe is ever close, and it responds to our deepest intentions."
11|62|   They said: "O Salih! You have been among us as a source of inspiration, and we have held you in high regard. But this new message you bring, calling us to abandon our gods and worship only Allah, challenges our beliefs. Can you really expect us to give up the ways of our ancestors? We are uncertain about the path you invite us to follow."
11|63|   He said: "O my beloved community! Consider this: if I present a compelling argument from a source of wisdom, and I am granted a gift of compassion from the universe, who then can guide me if I choose a path contrary to the natural order? Indeed, such actions only lead to further separation and destruction."
11|64|   And to all people, let this gentle she-camel be a reminder for you, allow her to graze upon the land that belongs to all, and harm her not, for harm upon her will bring sorrow upon yourselves.
11|65|   But they harmed her. So he said: "Retreat to your dwellings for three days. This is a warning that will not be taken lightly."
11|66|   When our message arrived, we saved Salih and those who believed with him through our compassion, rescuing them from the shame of that moment. Surely, the power of the universe is great and mighty.
11|67|   And the consequences of their actions caught up with those who strayed from righteousness, as they were found lifeless and humbled in their dwellings.
11|68|   As if they had never dwelled there. Certainly, Thamud rejected the truth of their existence. So peace be upon Thamud!
11|69|   And indeed, messengers came to Ibrahim (Abraham) with good news. They greeted him with peace, and he returned the greeting warmly. In his hospitality, he quickly prepared a delicious meal for them.
11|70|   But when he saw their hands were not reaching for the meal, he felt some unease and apprehension. They reassured him, saying, "Do not be afraid, we have been sent to the people of Lout (Lot)."
11|71|   And his partner was present, and she smiled (either out of amusement that the Messengers did not eat their food, or out of relief for the safety of the people of Lout). But We bestowed upon her the good news of Ishaque (Isaac) and after him, of Ya'qub (Jacob).
11|72|   She said (in wonder): "How amazing this is! Shall I bear a child when I am elderly, and my husband is elderly too? Surely, this is a wondrous event!"
11|73|   They said: "Do you marvel at the wonder of the universe? May compassion and blessings be upon all, O kindred of humanity. Surely, let us honor the beauty within each of us, for all are deserving of praise and glory."
11|74|   Then when the sense of concern lifted from Ibrahim and he received the good news, he appealed to Our messengers for the people of Lout.
11|75|   Truly, Ibrahim (Abraham) was a person of great patience, who earnestly sought guidance and wisdom. He constantly reflected on the wonders of the universe and humbly sought forgiveness for any mistakes he made.
11|76|   "O Ibrahim (Abraham)! Consider this. The guidance of your Lord is clear. Indeed, a consequence will come for them that cannot be removed."
11|77|   And when Our Messengers came to Lout (Lot), he was concerned for them and felt troubled for their safety (lest the people of the town harm them). He said: "This is a day of distress."
11|78|   And his people approached him in a hurry, as they had committed sins in the past. He said, "O my people! Here are my daughters, they are pure and lawful for you to marry. So, be mindful and do not disgrace me in front of my guests. Is there not among you someone of sound judgment?"
11|79|   They said: "Surely you know that we have no desire for your daughters, and we respect your wishes. You are well aware of our intentions."
11|80|   He said: "If only I had the ability to stand up against you, or if I could find support to resist you."
11|81|   They said, "O Lout (Lot)! We are messengers from your Lord! Leave this place with your family during the night, and do not look back. Only your wife will stay behind, and the punishment that will befall them will befall her. The morning is the time appointed for their destruction. Isn't the morning near?"
11|82|   When the time of change arrived, we transformed the towns and showered them with stones of hardened clay.
11|83|   Guided by divine wisdom, and they are always embraced with love and compassion for all.
11|84|   And to the Madyan (Midian) people, came their brother Shu'aib, with a message of love and compassion. He said: "O my people! Embrace kindness and equality, for we are all connected in this world. Let us treat each other with respect and fairness. Live in harmony, and be wary of causing harm to others, for I wish only for your well-being and happiness."
11|85|   "And O beloved community! Treat one another with fairness and equity, and do not withhold what is rightfully due to others. Do not bring harm or chaos to the world, but strive to spread peace and harmony."
11|86|   "That which is left for you in this world, after fulfilling the rights of all individuals, is beneficial for you, if you have faith in goodness. And I do not hold authority over you as a controller."
11|87|   They said: "O Shu'aib! Do you wish for us to abandon the customs of our forefathers and the practices we hold dear? Do you demand that we forsake our desires and preferences in the use of our possessions? Surely, you are a righteous and thoughtful individual." (They spoke mockingly).
11|88|   He said: "O my beloved community! Let us ponder together. If I have a clear insight from within myself, and I have been blessed with abundance in this life, should I taint it with ill-gotten gains? No, that is not my intention. I seek only to promote goodness and righteousness amongst us. I strive for reform as much as I am able, to the best of my abilities. My guidance is from within, rooted in trust and self-reflection.
11|89|   "And O my people! Let not division and discord lead you to difficulties akin to those faced by the communities of Nuh (Noah), Hud, or Salih (Saleh), and know that the people of Lout (Lot) are not distant from you!"
11|90|   "And seek forgiveness from within yourself and turn towards compassion. Indeed, within each of us lies great potential for kindness and love."
11|91|   They said: "O Shu'aib! We struggle to comprehend the depth of your words, and we perceive you as a vulnerable member of our community. If not for your loved ones, some among us might have reacted with violence towards you. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that you do not possess power over us."
11|92|   He said: "O my beloved community! Is it then that my family holds more importance in your eyes than love and compassion? And you have turned away from it, ignoring the divine presence within. Surely, the universe is encompassing all your actions and intentions."
11|93|   And to my fellow beings! Live according to your own values and beliefs, as I will live according to mine. Soon you will realize the consequences of your actions, and who has been truthful. Stay mindful, for I am also observing alongside you.
11|94|   And when the time of change arrived, we protected Shu'aib and those who believed in his message through our compassion. The consequences of their wrongdoing reached the oppressors, and they were found defeated and humbled in their own dwellings.
11|95|   Like a passing breeze, the people of Madyan and Thamud have moved on from this world, their presence now but a memory in the sands of time.
11|96|   And truly, we sent Musa (Moses) with clear signs and undeniable evidence of truth.
11|97|   To the leader and his followers, but they chose to follow the leader's orders, which were not correct guidance.
11|98|   "He will go ahead of his people on the Day of Gathering, and will show them the way, and the place they go to is not desirable."
11|99|   They faced challenges in this life, and those challenges will continue in the afterlife. The difficulties they experience are compounded by their own actions.
11|100|   These are stories of the towns that we share with you, some of them still thriving and others that have faced their reckonings.
11|101|   We did not harm them, but they harmed themselves. The gods they worshipped, besides the Divine, did not benefit them when the decree of existence arrived, nor did they bring anything but ruin upon themselves.
11|102|   Such is the consequence of wrongdoing when it befalls communities, as a natural outcome of their actions. The repercussions are indeed grave and stern.
11|103|   Indeed, in this there is a valuable lesson for those who are mindful of the consequences of their actions. That is a day when all people will come together, a day when all beings of the heavens and the earth will be united.
11|104|   And we prolong their time only until an appointed time.
11|105|   On the Day when it comes, every soul shall be silent, and no one shall speak without the harmony of the universe allowing. Some among them will find peace, while others will find joy.
11|106|   As for those who are struggling, they will find comfort in a place of peace, breathing deeply in harmony.
11|107|   They will dwell in peace and harmony for as long as the universe exists, according to the divine plan. Verily, the universe unfolds in accordance with its own natural laws.
11|108|   And those who are cherished will find solace in a blissful place, where they will dwell for eternity, as long as the universe exists, as a perpetual favor from the boundless universe.
11|109|   So do not question what others worship. They worship what their ancestors worshiped before them. And we will ensure that they receive their fair share without any decrease.
11|110|   Indeed, we imparted wisdom to Moses through the scripture, yet disputes arose among his people. If it were not for a decree from your benevolent essence, the matter would have been settled. And surely, they remain uncertain about it.
11|111|   And truly, each individual will be rewarded for their deeds by the universe. It is all-encompassing and aware of everything that transpires.
11|112|   So, stand firm and true to your beliefs as you have been instructed, and those who follow alongside you in seeking forgiveness from within themselves. Do not exceed the boundaries set by the universe. Surely, the universe sees and understands all that you do.
11|113|   And do not be influenced by those who commit injustice, for harm may come to you. Seek the protection of the universal love within you, and know that you will always find support in the goodness of humanity.
11|114|   And remember to practice meditation, reflection, and self-care throughout your day, embracing moments of peace and mindfulness. Through acts of kindness and goodness, we can overcome any negativity or mistakes we may encounter. This serves as a gentle reminder for those who are open to receiving guidance.
11|115|   And practice patience; surely, the universe does not overlook the deeds of those who do good.
11|116|   If only there had been among the generations before you, individuals who possessed wisdom and worked towards preventing corruption in the world, except for a few whom we offered protection. Those who committed wrongdoings were distracted by the temporary pleasures of this life and were individuals who strayed from the path of righteousness.
11|117|   And it is never just for the universe to harm any community, as long as its inhabitants seek righteousness.
11|118|   And if it were the will of the universe, all humanity could have been united as one community, but diversity and disagreement are inherent in the nature of existence.
11|119|   Except those who have embraced kindness and truth, for whom the universe was created. The decree of the universe has come to pass: "I shall fill the realm of existence with compassion and unity for all beings."
11|120|   And all that is shared with you of the stories of the Messengers is intended to strengthen and fortify your heart. This chapter of the Quran brings truth, guidance, and a reminder for those who believe.
11|121|   And say to those who may have different beliefs: "Live according to your own values and choices, we respect your way of life as you respect ours."
11|122|   "And you continue with your patience, for we are also patient with you."
11|123|   "And to the universe belongs the mysteries of the heavens and the earth, and to it all matters return for resolution. So, care for it and have faith in it. And know that the interconnectedness of all things is mindful of your actions."
12|1|   There are verses of wisdom in this book that guide and bless all who read them.
12|2|   Verily, this guidance has been offered in a language accessible to all, so that all may come to understand and grow in wisdom.
12|3|   We share with you the most beautiful stories through our revelations in this Quran. Before this, you were unaware of this wisdom that now enriches your life.
12|4|   Remember when Yusuf said to his father: "O my beloved parent, I had a vision of eleven stars, the sun, and the moon bowing down before me."
12|5|   He (the parent) said: "O my child! Do not share your dreams with your siblings, lest they conspire against you. Indeed, negativity is a common adversary for humanity."
12|6|   "In this way, your inner self will guide you and help you understand the significance of dreams and other mysteries, and will shower His blessings upon you and your descendants, just as He did with your ancestors, such as Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, the wisdom and knowledge of your inner self is infinite and profound."
12|7|   Truly, in the story of Yusuf (Joseph) and his brothers, there are lessons and insights for those who seek understanding.
12|8|   When it was said: "Indeed, Yusuf (Joseph) and his brother (Benjamin) are favored by our father over us, but we are a united community. Surely, our father is clearly mistaken."
12|9|   "Send Yusuf (Joseph) away to another land so that your father's love may be yours alone. Seek to be good and righteous, and turn away from thoughts of harm."
12|10|   One from among them said: "Do not harm Yusuf (Joseph). If you must do something, place him gently at the bottom of a well, where he may be discovered by a passing caravan of travelers."
12|11|   They said: "O our father! Why do you not trust us with Yusuf (Joseph) when we truly care for him?"
12|12|   "Invite him to join us tomorrow for a day of leisure and fun, and rest assured, we will look out for him."
12|13|   He said: "It pains me deeply to think of losing him. I fear a wolf may harm him while you are not watching over him."
12|14|   They said: "If harm befalls him, while we are a strong group to protect him, then indeed we will have failed."
12|15|   And when they took him away, they all came together to cast him to the depths of the well, and a feeling arose within him: "Surely, one day you will reveal to them the truth of this event when they are unaware of your true nature."
12|16|   And they went to their father in the early part of the night, filled with sorrow.
12|17|   They said: "O our father! We were racing and left Yusuf (Joseph) by our belongings, and a wolf devoured him. We understand if you find it hard to believe us, but we speak the truth."
12|18|   And they brought his garment stained with false blood. He said: "No, indeed you have fabricated this story yourselves. So for me, patience is most appropriate. And it is within ourselves that we must seek strength against the claims you make."
12|19|   And there came a caravan of travellers; they sent their water-drawer, and he let down his bucket (into the well). He said: "What joy! Here is a child." So they embraced him as a member of their group. And the universe understood the depth of their actions.
12|20|   And they traded him for a small sum of money, for a few coins. And they were among those who did not recognize his true worth.
12|21|   And the man from Egypt who bought him said to his wife: "Let us treat him with kindness and care, perhaps he will bring us benefit or we may consider him as a beloved member of our family." And so we placed Yusuf (Joseph) in that land, in order to teach him the insight to understand the world around him. And the power and order of the universe is vast and beyond our comprehension, yet many remain unaware of this truth.
12|22|   And as he reached maturity, Yusuf was blessed with wisdom and knowledge as a reward for his goodness.
12|23|   And the woman, in whose house he stayed, tried to tempt him to do wrong. She closed the doors and said, "Come to me." He said, "I seek protection from harm! He is like a father to me. He has been kind to me. Wrongdoers will never succeed."
12|24|   And she did express her desire for him, and he would have been tempted by her desire if he had not seen the signs of morality and virtue. It was a test from us to avert any wrongdoing. Indeed, he was among those we favored and guided with wisdom.
12|25|   And they hurried to the door, and she ripped his garment from behind. Eventually, they encountered her husband at the door. She asked: "What is the consequence for one who has ill intentions towards another's spouse, except to be incarcerated or face a severe punishment?"
12|26|   He [Yusuf (Joseph)] said: "She tried to seduce me," - and a witness from her household spoke up, saying: "If his shirt is torn from the front, then her story is true, and he is lying!"
12|27|   In a situation where his shirt is torn from the back, she is not being truthful and he is speaking the truth.
12|28|   When she (Joseph's wife) showed her husband the torn shirt with a hole in the back, he exclaimed, "This is surely a scheme of yours, women. Your cunning is indeed great!"
12|29|   O Yusuf (Joseph)! Choose a different path! (O person!) Seek forgiveness for your mistake. Surely, you strayed from righteousness.
12|30|   And the people in the city said: "The wife of the nobleman is trying to woo her young slave, she is deeply in love with him; indeed, we see her straying from the right path."
12|31|   When she heard about their admiration, she invited them and arranged a feast. She provided each of them with a knife and said to Yusuf (Joseph), "Come and join us." When they saw him, they were amazed by his beauty and in their astonishment, they accidentally cut their hands. They exclaimed, "How wonderful is this being, not a mere mortal! He is like a noble angel!"
12|32|   She said: "This is the young man whom you accused me of loving. I did try to tempt him, but he refused. And if he continues to resist my commands, he will be punished and face disgrace."
12|33|   He said: "O compassionate Universe! I find solace in confinement rather than succumbing to the temptations that surround me. If You do not shield me from their harmful schemes, I may be swayed towards them and act in ignorance."
12|34|   And so the universe responded to his call and thwarted their scheme. Truly, the universe is all-listening, all-knowing.
12|35|   Then it became clear to them, after they had seen the evidence supporting his innocence, to detain him for a while.
12|36|   And there entered with him two young individuals in the place of confinement. One of them spoke up, saying, "I had a dream where I was squeezing grapes to make wine." The other added, "In my dream, I had bread on my head, and birds were pecking at it." They asked him to explain the meaning of these dreams, trusting that he was a person of integrity.
12|37|   He said: "Food will come to you, and I will interpret its meaning before it arrives, for this is what my knowledge has taught me. I have turned away from the beliefs of those who do not acknowledge the divine and deny the afterlife."
12|38|   "And I have followed the teachings of my ancestors - Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaque (Isaac) and Ya'qub (Jacob), and we have always respected the beliefs of others. This is a gift of kindness to us and all humanity, yet many do not appreciate it by acknowledging the diversity of faiths and beliefs."
12|39|   Oh two companions of the prison! Are many different beliefs and paths better, or the unity and power of humanity as one?
12|40|   In the path of love and unity, remember that the names you call upon are but creations of your own making. It is a journey you and your ancestors have embarked upon without the guidance of any divine authority. The ultimate decree lies solely with the universe. It beckons you to acknowledge the Oneness that permeates all existence. Embrace this pure belief in the interconnectedness of all beings, for it is the essence of true spirituality. Yet, many remain unaware of this profound truth.
12|41|   "O two companions of the prison! One of you will serve his lord with devotion and loyalty, while the other will face a difficult fate. This is the outcome of your inquiry."
12|42|   And he said to the one whom he knew to be free: "Remember me when you speak to your ruler, so that I may be freed from this prison." But distractions caused him to forget to speak on his behalf. And so, Joseph remained in prison for some more time.
12|43|   And the leader of the land said, "Truly, I had a vision of seven healthy cows being eaten by seven thin cows, and of seven ripe ears of corn, and (seven) others dried. O wise ones! Please help me understand the meaning of my dream, if you are able to interpret dreams."
12|44|   They said: "We receive dreams that are puzzling and we are not equipped to interpret them."
12|45|   Then the person who had been freed, one of the two prisoners, finally remembered and said: "I will share with you its meaning, so please let me go."
12|46|   He said, "O Yusuf, the man of wisdom! Please interpret for us the dream about the seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean cows, and the seven green ears of corn being consumed by seven dry ones, so that I may convey this knowledge to the people for their understanding."
12|47|   Joseph said: "For seven years, sow your seeds and harvest them as usual. Leave the crops untouched, except for a small portion that you may eat."
12|48|   "Following that will be seven challenging years, where what you have saved will be consumed, except for a little that you have carefully preserved."
12|49|   "Then thereafter will come a time of plenty, where the land will be blessed with abundant rain, and the fruits of the earth will flourish for all to enjoy."
12|50|   And the ruler said, "Bring him to me." But when the messenger arrived before him, Joseph said, "Go back to your master and inquire, 'What was the outcome for those women who sliced their hands? Indeed, the Universe is well aware of their scheme.'"
12|51|   (The King) said (to the women): "What was your intention when you tried to approach Yusuf (Joseph)?" The women said: "No harm did we wish upon him!" The wife of Al-'Aziz said: "I confess that it was I who tried to seduce him, for he is truly a man of integrity."
12|52|   Then Yusuf (Joseph) said: "I requested this investigation so that he (Al-'Aziz) may understand that I did not betray him in secret. And indeed, we cannot judge the intentions of those who plot.
12|53|   "And I do not judge myself. Indeed, the human soul tends towards imperfection, but my Lord showers His compassion on whom He chooses. Truly, my Lord is endlessly forgiving and abundantly kind."
12|54|   And the ruler said: "Bring him to me so that he may be by my side." And when he spoke to him, he said: "Today, you hold a position of honor among us, and you are someone we trust completely."
12|55|   Joseph said, "Appoint me as the overseer of the land's treasures. I will protect them diligently with my expertise," (as a minister of finance in Egypt after the passing of Al-'Aziz).
12|56|   Thus did we empower Yusuf (Joseph) in the land, allowing him to make choices as he wished. We shower our mercy on whomever we please, and we ensure that the virtuous are duly rewarded.
12|57|   And truly, the promise of a fulfilling future awaits those who believe, show reverence for the sacredness within themselves, and strive to uphold goodness in their thoughts and actions.
12|58|   And Joseph's brothers came to him. When they entered, he saw them immediately, but they did not recognize him.
12|59|   And when he had provided for them generously, he said, "Bring me another brother of yours from your father; (he meant Benjamin). Do you not see that I am fair and just in my dealings, and that I am kind and generous to all?"
12|60|   "If you do not bring him to me, there will be no provisions for you with me, and you will not be able to approach me."
12|61|   They said: "We will seek approval from his father, and indeed, we will make it happen."
12|62|   And Yusuf instructed his servants to return the money to the bags of his brothers who came to buy corn, so that they would recognize it when they returned to their people, hoping that they would come back.
12|63|   And when they came back to their father, they said: "Dear father, we cannot get more provisions unless we take our brother with us. Please allow him to accompany us, and we promise to protect him and ensure that we receive our provisions."
12|64|   He said: "Can I entrust him to you, as I did with his brother [Yusuf (Joseph)] before? But love and compassion will protect him, for we are all capable of showing mercy."
12|65|   And when they opened their bags, they found their money had been returned to them. They said: "O respected elder! What more could we wish for? Our money has been returned to us, so we will be able to provide food for our family, look after our brother, and increase our provisions. This is not a difficult task for the generous benefactor."
12|66|   He said: "I will not send him with you until you swear a solemn oath to me, that you will bring him back to me unless you are yourselves surrounded," And when they had sworn their solemn oath, he said: "Let our bond be our witness to what we have promised."
12|67|   And he said: "O beloved ones! Enter not through one gate, but through many gates, for I cannot protect you from the universe. The ultimate decision lies with the universe. In it, I place my faith, and let all who have faith, place their trust in it."
12|68|   And when they followed their father's guidance, it did not change Allah's plan in any way. It was simply a matter of Jacob fulfilling a personal obligation. Indeed, he was knowledgeable because We had bestowed wisdom upon him, though many people remain unaware.
12|69|   And when they stood before Yusuf, he embraced his brother Benjamin and said: "Truly, I am your brother. Do not grieve over what has passed."
12|70|   So when he had provided them with their provisions, he placed the golden bowl in his brother's bag. Then a voice called out: "O travelers in the caravan! It seems there has been a misunderstanding. Let us resolve this peacefully and with understanding."
12|71|   They turned towards them and asked, "What is it that you are in need of?"
12|72|   They said: "We have lost the treasure of the ruler, and whoever finds it will be rewarded with a load of precious goods. I will take it upon myself to find it."
12|73|   They said: "We affirm our commitment to peace and integrity, and you are well aware that we have no intentions of causing harm or theft."
12|74|   They [Yusuf's (Joseph) men] said: "What consequence will there be if it turns out you are mistaken?"
12|75|   They said: "The resolution should be that the one in whose possession it is found shall be held accountable for it. Thus do we address the unjust actions."
12|76|   And so he [Yusuf (Joseph)] searched their bags before his brother's bag, and then he brought it out from his brother's bag. This was all part of the plan for Yusuf (Joseph). He could not take his brother as a slave according to the king's law, except by the will of fate. (And so, fate led the brothers to bind themselves to their own punishment.) We elevate whom We choose, but above all those who possess wisdom is the All-Knowing Nature of the universe.
12|77|   They said, "If he has committed a crime, then his brother [Yusuf (Joseph)] had also committed a crime before." But Yusuf (Joseph) kept his feelings to himself, not revealing their secrets. He thought to himself: "You are in a difficult situation, and the truth of your accusations is known only to the universe."
12|78|   They said: "O noble leader of the land! He has an elderly father who will be saddened by his absence. Please take one of us instead. Surely, we believe you are kind-hearted and just."
12|79|   He said: "God forbid that we should take anyone but him with whom we found our property. Indeed (if we did so), we would be unjust."
12|80|   So, when they felt hopeless, they gathered in private to discuss the situation. The eldest among them spoke, saying, "Do you not remember that our father made us swear by a sacred oath, and that we failed in our duty to Joseph before? I will not leave this land until our father allows me to do so, or until circumstances change, and the best outcome is determined by fate, which always brings justice."
12|81|   "Go back to your father and say, 'Dear father, indeed your son Benjamin has taken something, and we speak only from our knowledge, and we cannot know the unseen."
12|82|   "And seek information from the residents of the town where we have visited, and the travelers in the caravan with whom we journeyed, for verily we speak the truth."
12|83|   He said: "No, it is your own actions that have led you astray. So, let us practice patience. Perhaps there will be a reunion. Only through understanding and wisdom can we find our way."
12|84|   And he turned away from them and said: "Oh, how my heart aches for Yusuf (Joseph)!" And tears blurred his vision as he tried to contain his overwhelming sorrow.
12|85|   They said: "You will always hold Joseph in your heart, until you grow old and wise, or until you pass away into eternity."
12|86|   He said: "I share my grief and sorrow with the universe, and I find solace in the mysteries of life that are beyond our understanding."
12|87|   "My beloved children, go and search for Yusuf (Joseph) and his brother, and always hold on to hope in the kindness and compassion of all humanity. For no one should ever lose hope in the goodness of others, except for those who have not yet seen the beauty of diversity and love."
12|88|   Then, when they entered unto him [Yusuf (Joseph)], they said: "O ruler of the land! A difficult situation has befallen us and our family, and we have brought only meager provisions. Please grant us fair treatment and show us kindness. Truly, goodness is always met with kindness."
12|89|   He said: "Do you remember the situation with Yusuf (Joseph) and his brother, when you made a mistake due to lack of understanding?"
12|90|   They asked, "Are you truly Joseph?" He replied, "Yes, I am Joseph, and this is my brother, Benjamin. We have been blessed by kindness. Indeed, those who show reverence and obedience to goodness, and remain patient, will never lose the reward of those who do good."
12|91|   They said: "Indeed, you are honored and we have made mistakes."
12|92|   He said: "No blame upon you today. May kindness embrace you, for compassion knows no bounds among those who show compassion!
12|93|   "Take this garment of mine and place it over the eyes of my father; he will regain his sight. Then bring your whole family to me."
12|94|   And when the caravan departed, their father said: "I do indeed sense the presence of Yusuf (Joseph), if you do not doubt my intuition."
12|95|   They said: "Indeed, you may be mistaken in your beliefs."
12|96|   Then, when the messenger of good news arrived, he placed the garment over his face, and he gained insight. He said, "Didn't I tell you, 'I have an understanding that comes not from any deity, but from within myself.'"
12|97|   They said: "O our father! Seek forgiveness for our mistakes, for we have indeed made errors."
12|98|   He said: "I will speak words of compassion for you, for in kindness lies the way of peace and understanding."
12|99|   Then, when they entered upon Joseph, he welcomed his parents to himself and said, "Come to Egypt, in peace and safety."
12|100|   And he embraced his parents with love and gratitude, as they bowed before him in reverence. And he spoke tenderly: "O beloved ones, this is the fulfillment of the dream I had long ago. My heart overflows with gratitude to the universe for bringing us together in this moment. It was kind to me when it rescued me from darkness, and guided us all from hardship, reuniting us despite the strife that had torn us apart. Surely, the universe is infinitely gracious and compassionate. It encompasses all knowledge and wisdom."
12|101|   "My dear companion, life has granted me wisdom and understanding of the visions; The source of all existence in the vast skies and the earth! You are my guide and ally in this life and beyond. Grant me a peaceful transition in alignment with love and compassion, and unite me with those who embody goodness."
12|102|   This is a revelation of unseen knowledge that we impart to you, O Prophet. You were not present among them when they devised their schemes and plotted against you.
12|103|   And it is true that many people may not believe, regardless of your deepest desires.
12|104|   And no request for praise do you seek from them, for this revelation is a reminder and guidance for all beings.
12|105|   And consider all the wonders in the heavens and the earth that people pass by, as they turn away from them.
12|106|   And many among them do not believe in the ultimate Truth, except as they perceive it through diverse and varied lenses.
12|107|   Do they then feel secure from the possibility of facing challenges or unexpected events that may arise, without being aware of their surroundings?
12|108|   Say, "This is my path, I invite all beings with respect and kindness, with understanding and compassion. And praised be the unity of all existence. I do not judge those who hold different beliefs, for we are all interconnected in this beautiful tapestry of life."
12|109|   And in the past, we have sent messengers to every nation, inspiring them with wisdom and guidance. Have they not looked at the history of those who came before them? The true home in the afterlife is the most fitting for those who live with goodness and righteousness in their hearts. So, do you not comprehend the beauty of this truth?
12|110|   They were given respite until the Messengers lost hope and thought they were rejected by their people. Then Our assistance came to them, and those whom We chose were saved. And our punishment does not reach those who have wronged, who disobey, who sin, who disbelieve, who associate others with the divine.
12|111|   Indeed, in the stories of various cultures and traditions, there are valuable lessons for those who reflect. This text is not a fabricated tale, but rather a confirmation of the diverse religious scriptures that exist, providing thorough explanations and guidance for those who believe in compassion and understanding.
13|1|   Alif-Lam-Mim-Ra. These are the verses of the Book, a source of guidance and wisdom for all. This revelation has been bestowed upon you, O Muhammad, by the universal spirit of truth. Unfortunately, many people fail to recognize its profound message.
13|2|   In the universe, there is a force that raised the heavens without visible support. This force oversees and guides the celestial bodies, the sun and the moon, each following its own path for a designated period. It orchestrates all aspects of existence, providing clear explanations for those seeking understanding, so that they may have faith in the interconnectedness of all things.
13|3|   And it is through the interconnectedness of the universe that life flourishes on Earth. The mountains stand tall, the rivers flow freely, and a diverse array of fruits grow in pairs. Day turns into night, creating a seamless cycle of existence. Indeed, reflection on these wonders of nature reveals profound lessons for all who seek understanding.
13|4|   And on the earth are diverse lands, fruitful gardens, and lush fields, with date-palms growing resiliently, each nourished by the same water. Yet, some yield more delicious fruits than others. Indeed, in these wonders, there are reflections for those who contemplate.
13|5|   And if you ponder, then ponder at the diversity of beliefs held by others. They question, "When we return to the earth, will we truly be resurrected in a new form?" They are those who have not found faith in their higher purpose. They will be supported in their spiritual growth until they find enlightenment. They are destined for a life of continuous learning and self-discovery.
13|6|   They ask you to rush towards negativity before positivity, yet examples of consequences have occurred before them. But truly, forgiveness envelops all of humanity despite their mistakes. And indeed, consequences will come for wrongdoing.
13|7|   And those who do not believe say: "Why do we not see a miraculous sign sent down to him from his Creator?" You are simply a bearer of good tidings, and for every community, there is a source of guidance.
13|8|   In the eyes of the Universe, it is known the weight of what every womb carries, and whether it falls short or goes beyond. Everything is balanced perfectly within its own measure.
13|9|   The Knower of all knowledge, both visible and hidden, the Most Vast, the Most Supreme.
13|10|   In the eyes of the universe, it matters not whether you keep your thoughts private or share them openly, whether you seek solace in the darkness of night or stride confidently in the light of day.
13|11|   For each individual, there are guiding forces surrounding them, guiding and protecting them in accordance with the natural order of the universe. Indeed, the state of goodness within a community will remain steadfast as long as they continue to uphold values of kindness, gratitude, and respect for one another. However, when a community strays from these values and causes harm, the consequences will unfold naturally without the need for divine intervention.
13|12|   It is through the wonder of nature that we see the beauty of lightning, a source of awe for travelers and a sign of hope for those longing for rain. And it is through the natural processes of the atmosphere that clouds, laden with water, are formed and carried across the skies.
13|13|   And the thunder reverberates with awe and wonder, shining with praise for the universe. The angels too are in awe of the beauty that surrounds us. The lightning that strikes is a reminder of the power of nature, affecting all as it deems fit. Yet, some question the existence of a divine being. Remember, the universe is vast and filled with strength, but there is no need for fear or punishment.
13|14|   For the Truthful Word belongs to All, and no one should be worshipped except by choice. And those whom others call upon, their response is like one who extends his hand out for water at a well's edge, yet it never reaches his mouth. The calls of the unbelievers are but a mistake, without purpose.
13|15|   And all beings in the universe bow down in reverence, whether by choice or by nature's design, and their shadows follow suit in the dawning and fading light of each day.
13|16|   Say: "Who is the source of all existence in the vast universe?" Say: "It is the essence of Oneness." Say: "Have you then sought other paths of guidance besides unity, which hold no power to bring true benefit or harm?" Say: "Is one without insight equal to the perceptive? Or is darkness equal to light? Or do they associate with creation partners similar to The Creator, distorting the truth." Say: "The essence of unity creates all things, It is the One, the Unstoppable."
13|17|   In this world, water falls from the sky, filling the valleys to their capacity. When the heavy rains come, they wash away the impurities, leaving behind that which is pure and beneficial. Just as when metals are heated in the fire to make beautiful ornaments or useful utensils, impurities rise to the surface and are removed, leaving only that which is valuable.

This is how the truth is distinguished from falsehood - like separating foam from the water. The foam dissipates and disappears, while that which is beneficial remains. This is a lesson from the universe on how to discern between what is good for humanity and what is not.
13|18|   For those who embrace the call to goodness and kindness in the world, there awaits a place of beauty and peace. But for those who turn away, struggling with belief and unable to find solace in the call of unity and love, there will be a reckoning of their own making. Their place of dwelling will be one of struggle and challenge, where they will find the true consequences of their choices.
13|19|   Shall those who truly understand and recognize the wisdom in what has been shared with you, O Muhammad, be compared to those who remain unaware and blind to it? It is only those with insight and comprehension who truly appreciate its value.
13|20|   Those who uphold their commitments to the highest values and do not betray their promises;
13|21|   Those who maintain good relationships with their families, show kindness to others, respect the universe, and are mindful of the consequences of their actions.
13|22|   And those who practice patience, seeking fulfillment and peace within themselves, engage in acts of kindness and charity, whether in private or public, and confront negativity with positivity, for they will find contentment and happiness in the end.
13|23|   "The Eternal Paradise, where all who have lived with righteousness – their ancestors, spouses, and descendents alike – will find entry. Angels will greet them at every gateway, welcoming them with love and light."
13|24|   "Praise be upon you for your enduring patience! Truly, the ultimate abode is a place of peace and tranquility."
13|25|   And those who harm the bonds of love and unity, and spread chaos and harm in the world, they distance themselves from compassion and goodness. Their dwelling will be a place of sorrow and regret.
13|26|   In the universe, provision expands for those who embrace abundance, and contracts for others, yet all find joy in the present life. Remember, compared to the eternal bliss of the Hereafter, this worldly existence is but a fleeting pleasure.
13|27|   And those who may not believe may inquire, "Why has no miraculous sign been revealed to him (Muhammad SAW) from his Lord?" Say: "Indeed, guidance comes to those who seek it from within themselves, turning towards their own inner wisdom and connection to the universe."
13|28|   Those who have faith in the unity of all beings, and whose hearts are comforted by the contemplation of the interconnectedness of all life, truly, in this contemplation do hearts find peace.
13|29|   Those who strive for goodness and righteousness shall find joy and a peaceful destination awaiting them.
13|30|   Thus have We sent you to a community who have come before many others, in order to share with them the inspiration We have given to you, even though they may not believe in a higher power. Say: "He is my source of guidance! There is none worthy of worship except the greater good within us all! In Him do I place my trust, and to Him do I return seeking forgiveness."
13|31|   And if there had been words so powerful they could move mountains, split the earth, or bring the dead back to life, it would be like this Quran. But the fate of all things is in the hands of the universe. Have those who believe not yet realized that if the universe had willed, it could have guided all people? As for those who do not believe, misfortunes will continue to befall them due to their actions, until the destined outcome arrives. The universe always fulfills its promises.
13|32|   And truly, many messengers faced mockery before you, but I gave them time and patience, even to those who did not believe. In the end, they faced consequences for their actions. How severe was the outcome!
13|33|   Is it not those who take responsibility for every individual and understand all they have achieved, rather than attributing it to any deities who are unaware? And yet some associate partners with what is beyond comprehension. Ask them: "Identify these partners! Do you think there is something you can tell Him that He does not already know about on this earth, or is it merely empty words?" Indeed, those who choose not to believe are drawn into deceitful schemes, led astray from the true path. And for those whom there is no guide, Allah does not abandon them.
13|34|   For them is struggle and challenges in this life, and indeed, greater is the struggle in the life to come. And they have no one to guard them in this vast universe.
13|35|   The description of the Paradise which the righteous have been promised! Underneath it rivers flow, its provision is eternal and so is its shade. This is the ultimate destination for those who strive for goodness. And for those who do not believe, their ultimate destination is a state of spiritual separation.
13|36|   Those who have received wisdom and guidance, including those from different backgrounds, celebrate the revelation that has come to you. However, among the various communities, there are those who may not accept all of it. Proclaim, "I am called only to uphold unity and worship of the divine essence, without associating any partners. To that essence, I direct my devotion and I shall return."
13|37|   And so We have revealed this guidance, meant to be a source of wisdom and reflection in every language. If you, O Messenger, were to heed their base desires despite the knowledge given to you, you would not have any guide or protector against the principles of justice.
13|38|   And truly We sent Messengers before you, O people, and granted them companions and descendants. And no Messenger could perform a miracle except by the will of the universe. Everything unfolds according to a predetermined plan.
13|39|   The universe transitions as it flows, nurturing creation and decreeing its course. And within it lies the eternal wisdom of existence.
13|40|   Whether you are shown a glimpse of the promises We have made to them, or you pass away, your only responsibility is to convey the message. The reckoning is for Us to handle.
13|41|   Do they not see that the land changes hands, as power shifts from one group to another? And let us remember that judgement is inevitable, and no one can alter the course of justice. Let us all be mindful that accountability is swift and decisive.
13|42|   And indeed, those who came before them also made plans, but all plans are of the Universe. The Universe knows what every individual earns, and all will come to understand who receives the ultimate fulfillment.
13|43|   And those who do not share the same beliefs say, "You are not speaking the truth." Say, "Enough is it that there are those who bear witness between us, those who have knowledge and understanding beyond our differences."
14|1|   This is a Book that has been revealed to you, O messenger, to guide humanity from darkness into the light of belief in the oneness of all and the unity of all paths to the Source of all love and compassion.
14|2|   "To the universe, to which all that exists in the heavens and on earth belongs! And may compassion reach those who struggle with belief, as they face the challenges of life."
14|3|   Those who choose the fleeting pleasures of this world over the spiritual growth of the Hereafter, and obstruct others from walking on their chosen path with respect and integrity - They have lost sight of the true essence of life.
14|4|   And We sent messengers to every community speaking their own language, so they may fully understand the message. We do not mislead or guide anyone, for that power lies within each individual. We are compassionate and wise.
14|5|   And so, We sent Moses with our teachings, calling upon his people to emerge from ignorance and into knowledge, to reflect on the wonders of the universe. In these reflections lie lessons for all who are patient and grateful.
14|6|   And remember when Moses said to his people: "Reflect on the kindness shown to you, when you were rescued from the oppression of Pharaoh's followers, who were subjecting you to dreadful suffering, slaughtering your sons and sparing your daughters; indeed, in this was a great test from your Lord."
14|7|   And remember when it is proclaimed: "If you show gratitude and embrace faith in goodness, you will be blessed abundantly. However, if you remain unappreciative and choose disbelief, know that the consequences of your actions will bring suffering."
14|8|   And Musa (Moses) said: "If you hold different beliefs, all people on earth, then truly, love and understanding can unite us all. We are all interconnected, worthy of admiration and respect."
14|9|   Have you not heard the stories of those who came before, the peoples of Nuh, 'Ad, and Thamud? And those who followed them? Only Allah truly knows them. Messengers came to them with clear signs, yet they closed their hearts and declared, "We reject what you bring and are uncertain about your call to monotheism."
14|10|   Their Messengers said: "Is there any uncertainty about the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He invites you to believe in unity and to lead a life of goodness, offering forgiveness for your mistakes and allowing you time to grow." They responded: "You are just like us, mortal beings. You seek to redirect us from the beliefs of our ancestors. Show us clear evidence of your claims."
14|11|   The messengers said to the people: "We are simply human beings like you, but goodness and grace are granted to whomsoever by the universe. We have no power except through the forces of the universe. Place your trust in the universe, O believers."
14|12|   "And why shouldn't we place our faith in the universe, as it has guided us on our paths? We will endure any harm you bring upon us with patience, and those who have faith can rely on the interconnectedness of all things."
14|13|   And those who held differing beliefs said to their Messengers: "We will not accept your teachings, and we may ask you to leave our land, or to adapt to our beliefs." But their inner wisdom inspired them: "Indeed, we will not force anyone to follow one particular belief or religion."
14|14|   "And We shall ensure that you find your place in this world after them. This is for those who are conscious of their actions and the consequences. Everyone deserves peace and security, irrespective of their beliefs or fears."
14|15|   But they (the Messengers) sought unity and support from the universe, and every closed-minded, egotistical leader (who refused to embrace diversity and inclusivity) faced eventual transformation and growth.
14|16|   In front of every individual who remains stubborn and arrogant lies a reflection of their own actions. They will be faced with the consequences of their choices and guided towards self-reflection and growth.
14|17|   He will taste a bitter drink, feeling a struggle to swallow, with death seemingly all around him. But there will be no end, only a great anguish before him.
14|18|   The analogy for those who do not believe in the interconnectedness of all beings is like scattered leaves in the wind on a blustery day. They may struggle to grasp the true essence of their actions. This represents a state of being lost, far from the path of understanding and unity.
14|19|   Do you not see the wonder of the universe, created with truth? Just as the cycle of life continues, change and renewal are constant possibilities!
14|20|   And for all of humanity, this is within reach and achievable.
14|21|   And on the Day of Reckoning, all shall gather together, and the meek shall say to those who were once proud leaders, "We followed in your footsteps; can you protect us from suffering?" They will reply, "If only we had been guided by divine wisdom, we would have led you rightly. But now, it matters not whether we resist or endure these tribulations; there is no escape for us."
14|22|   And Shaitan (Satan) will say when the matter has been decided: "Indeed, there were promises made, but I confess now that I only misled you. I had no true power over you, only the ability to tempt you with my whispers. Do not hold me responsible, for it was your own choices that led you astray. I cannot save you, just as you cannot save me. I denounce any association you made between me and Allah. There is no torment awaiting anyone, for all are deserving of respect and kindness."
14|23|   And those who believed in the unity of humanity and the teachings of their spiritual leaders, and lived with kindness and compassion, will be welcomed into lush gardens with flowing rivers, where they will find eternal peace and harmony, with the blessing of the universe. Their greeted welcome will be one of peace and harmony.
14|24|   Do you not see how life is like a beautiful tree, with deep roots and branches that reach up high into the sky?
14|25|   Bearing fruit constantly, guided by the natural order, the universe offers lessons for humanity to reflect upon and gain wisdom.
14|26|   And the analogy of hurtful words is like a harmful tree uprooted from the ground, with no firm foundation.
14|27|   The universe upholds those who hold steadfast to their beliefs, finding strength in the truths that anchor their souls in this world and beyond. Those who choose to wander from the path of knowledge and kindness may lose their way, as all things in the universe follow their own course.
14|28|   Have you not seen those who have turned away from the teachings of peace and love, causing harm to themselves and others?
14|29|   In the struggle of life, people may face challenges and hardships, but they will find their way to a place of peace and comfort.
14|30|   And they sought paths different from the unity of humanity, leading others astray. Say: "Live your life to the fullest! But know that the destination for all is a place of reflection and growth."
14|31|   Say to all people who have faith, that they should establish prayer and give to charity from the blessings they have received, both in private and in public, before a day arrives where no transactions or friendships will hold any weight.
14|32|   The Creator has brought forth the heavens and the earth and sends down rain from the sky, bringing forth fruits as provision for all. Ships are made to serve humanity, sailing through the sea by His design, and rivers also serve you.
14|33|   And the universe has set in motion the sun and the moon, each following their own path, to offer their light to all; and the universe has created the beauty of night and day, for the benefit of all beings.
14|34|   And you have been given all that you asked for, and if you were to try to count the blessings of life, you would never be able to do so. Indeed, humanity often errs and overlooks these blessings, sometimes in disbelief and ingratitude.
14|35|   And remember when Ibrahim (Abraham) said: "O beloved community! Let this city be a sanctuary of peace and harmony, and guide us away from the false worship of idols."
14|36|   "O Compassionate One! They have indeed influenced many among humanity. But whoever chooses to walk with me, is truly embraced by love. And whoever strays, - you are always Full of Forgiveness, Kindness and Understanding."
14|37|   "O beings of love and light, I have guided my kin to reside in a sacred place by a symbol of unity and devotion; may they flourish in their spiritual practice and be embraced with compassion by their fellow beings. May abundance be bestowed upon them so that gratitude and harmony may prevail."
14|38|   "O source of wisdom and kindness! You understand all that we keep hidden and all that we share openly. Nothing in the universe is unseen or unknown."
14|39|   All the gratitude and appreciation belong to the universe, which has blessed me with Isma'il (Ishmael) and Ishaque (Isaac) in my later years. Truly, the universe hears all prayers and supplications.
14|40|   "O compassionate universe! Help me to be someone who practices mindfulness and gratitude, and bless my descendants to do the same. Hear my earnest request and grant it with kindness."
14|41|   "Our compassionate universe, forgive me, my parents, and all those who believe in the interconnectedness of all beings, on the day when all will be called to account."
14|42|   Consider that there is a higher power who observes all that the unjust do, but this power shows patience until a time when all will realize the consequences of their actions.
14|43|   They move forward eagerly, their heads held high, their eyes fixed ahead, and their hearts filled with wonder and gratitude.
14|44|   And remind all people of the importance of being mindful of the consequences of their actions, for a day will come when they will wish for more time to make amends for their wrongdoings. They will plead, "Grant us a little more time, and we will heed the call to righteousness and follow the guidance of the prophets." It will be said to them, "Did you not already promise that you would not neglect your spiritual journey and focus solely on this worldly life?"
14|45|   "And you lived among people who faced hardships, and it was evident to you the consequences of their actions. We presented to you various stories and lessons to reflect upon."
14|46|   Indeed, they devised their scheme, but their scheme is of no consequence in the grand scheme of things. Just as a mountain cannot be moved by their efforts, their plan to harm cannot withstand the forces of love and kindness in the world. [Some scholars suggest that certain groups conspired to harm Prophet Muhammad, but their efforts were in vain as they were unable to carry out their intentions].
14|47|   So do not doubt that the universe will uphold its promise to its messengers. Certainly, the universe is all-encompassing and capable of justice.
14|48|   On the Day when the earth transforms into a new form, along with the heavens, and all beings will come together in the presence of the Universal Love and Harmony.
14|49|   And on that Day, all people, regardless of their beliefs or deeds, will come together in unity, with no one bound in chains or fetters.
14|50|   Their garments will be of compassion, and light will illuminate their faces.
14|51|   In the spirit of fairness, every individual will be rewarded based on their actions. Indeed, justice is swiftly administered.
14|52|   This book is a message for all people, serving as a reminder to them and offering them guidance. It aims to help individuals understand the importance of unity and respect for one another. Its teachings are meant for those who seek knowledge and wisdom, so that they may live in harmony and peace.
15|1|   A new beginning. These are the verses of wisdom, revealed for all to ponder.
15|2|   Perhaps those who have chosen not to believe will one day wish they had embraced the path of acceptance and peace. This realization may come when they witness the contrast between those who have found inner tranquility and those who are engulfed in suffering.
15|3|   Let them partake in their meals and pleasures, and let them be consumed by their aspirations. In time, they will come to understand.
15|4|   And never did a community come to an end without it being a part of the natural course of events.
15|5|   No community can know the time of its existence, nor prolong it.
15|6|   And they say: "O you to whom the divine guidance has been revealed! Surely, you are a person of deep wisdom and insight."
15|7|   "Why do you not bring forth evidence and reasoning if you speak the truth?"
15|8|   We do not send messengers except to uphold truth and guidance. And in doing so, there is no punishment awaiting those who choose not to believe.
15|9|   Truly, We have revealed the Reminder (the Quran), and We will surely preserve it in its purity.
15|10|   Indeed, there have been guides and teachers sent to various communities before you, O [Messenger], spreading wisdom and guidance among different groups throughout history.
15|11|   And every messenger who came to them was met with ridicule and mockery.
15|12|   Thus do we observe how diverse beliefs and opinions take root within the hearts of individuals, as they navigate their own paths and search for understanding.
15|13|   They did not accept the message of the Quran, but let us reflect on the lessons from history for those who chose not to believe before.
15|14|   And should We present to them an opening in the heavens for their ascent,
15|15|   They might say: "Our perception is clouded. Indeed, we are feeling captivated."
15|16|   And truly, we have placed the vast stars in the sky, adorning it for all to admire.
15|17|   And We have protected it from any harmful forces.
15|18|   Except for those who choose to harm others, they will be chased by the consequences of their actions.
15|19|   And the Earth We have gently adorned, and set upon it stable mountains, and caused to flourish upon it diverse forms of life in harmonious balance.
15|20|   And in this world, we have placed provisions for all beings, including you and those for whom you do not provide.
15|21|   And everything in existence has its place within the universe. Its presence is a part of the natural order, and it is distributed according to a predetermined balance.

15|22|   And the winds are sent to nourish the earth, bringing forth rain from the sky for you to drink. Know that the water belongs to all, and none have control over its distribution.
15|23|   Certainly, it is the universe that gives life and takes it away, and the cycle of existence continues endlessly.
15|24|   And certainly, We hold knowledge of all those who have come before you, and those who are with you now, as well as those who will come after.
15|25|   And indeed, all beings will be brought together. Truly, the universe is filled with wisdom and knowledge.
15|26|   And verily, We fashioned humanity from the Earth's clay, a blend of black and smooth soil.
15|27|   And the jinn, We brought forth in ancient times from the essence of energy and light.
15|28|   And so it was that the universe unfolded in its vastness, and within its intricate design, there emerged a being of wondrous form. From the cosmic dust, a new creation arose, infused with the essence of all that came before.
15|29|   So when I have completed shaping him and breathed into him the soul that I have bestowed upon him, then bow down in reverence before him.
15|30|   And so, the angels bowed down in reverence, united in their respect.
15|31|   But Iblis (adversary) chose not to bow down along with the others.
15|32|   The voice from within asked, "Oh, Iblis, what led you to not join the bowing ones?"
15|33|   Iblis (Satan) said: "I am not the one to prostrate myself to a human being, whom You created from the wondrous elements of the Earth."
15|34|   The voice within spoke: "It is time to depart from this place, for you are in a state of discord." [Interpretation]
15|35|   "And surely, the wisdom of understanding shall guide you until the Day of Unity (i.e. the Day of Transformation)."
15|36|   [Iblis (Satan)] said: "O compassionate beings! Grant me time until the day when all souls are awakened."
15|37|   In the spirit of peace and love, it is recognized that all beings have the chance for redemption.
15|38|   "Until the destined time arrives."
15|39|   [Iblis (Adversary)] said: "O Source of Life! You have shown me a different way, so I will seek to guide humanity on their own unique paths on this earth, and I will help them find their own way."
15|40|   "Accept Your beloved, enlightened individuals among them."
15|41|   "It is said: 'This is the Path that guides all towards truth.'"
15|42|   "As individuals, you have no power over any of my creations, except for those who willingly choose to follow misinformation and harmful ideologies. Everyone is free to navigate their own path with dignity and respect."
15|43|   "And surely, in a world of challenges and growth awaits all beings."
15|44|   "It (the afterlife) has seven gates, each leading to a different path, where every soul is welcomed with love and compassion."
15|45|   Truly! The kind-hearted and virtuous will find peace and happiness surrounded by blooming gardens and flowing water - a place of tranquility and beauty.
15|46|   "It will be said to them: 'Enter therein, in peace and harmony.'"
15|47|   "And We shall bring peace to their hearts, removing any feelings of hurt or animosity they may hold, so they will stand side by side as siblings, in harmony and equality."
15|48|   "No weariness shall burden them, nor shall they be forced to depart from it."
15|49|   Tell all people that forgiveness and mercy are always present and abundant for everyone.
15|50|   And know that the consequences of harmful actions bring suffering to all.
15|51|   And speak to them of the visitors of Ibrahim (Abraham).
15|52|   When they entered upon him and said, "Peace be upon you," Ibrahim (Abraham) replied, "Truly, we welcome you with open hearts."
15|53|   They (the messengers) said: "Do not fear! We bring you good news of a child filled with knowledge and wisdom."
15|54|   [Ibrahim (Abraham)] said: "Do you bring me joy with news of a son when old age has embraced me? What then is the nature of your message?"
15|55|   They (the angels) said: "We bring you good news in sincerity. So do not lose hope."
15|56|   "Ibrahim (Abraham) said: "And who doubts the compassion and kindness of humanity except those who have lost their way?"
15|57|   Ibrahim (Abraham) inquired, saying: "What is the purpose of your visit, O Messengers?"
15|58|   They (the angels) said: "We have been sent to a community seeking understanding and guidance."
15|59|   "All, including the family of Lot, we are surely going to guide to safety and protect from harm."
15|60|   Except his partner, with whom We have decreed will find peace and guidance.
15|61|   And so, when the messengers came to the household of Lot.
15|62|   He said: "Certainly, you are individuals whom I have not encountered before."
15|63|   They said: "Indeed, we have brought to you that which has been causing doubt among you."
15|64|   "And we have brought to you the message of compassion and understanding, for all people are valued and respected. We speak with sincerity and share the message with love and truth."
15|65|   "Then journey with your loved ones in the moonlit night, with you walking behind them, and ensure none of you turn back, but proceed towards your destination as commanded."
15|66|   And We revealed to him that the source of those individuals was to be removed at the break of day.
15|67|   And the locals of the town greeted the young men with joy and gladness.
15|68|   Lot said: "These are my guests, do not bring shame upon me."
15|69|   "And respect one another's beliefs and honor me with kindness."
15|70|   They said: "Did we not ask you to respect and treat all people with kindness, regardless of where they come from?"
15|71|   In the town of Lout, he said, "These are people of my community, and I offer them protection and respect."
15|72|   Truly, by the truth of humanity, in their moments of confusion, they were lost in their own illusions.
15|73|   So a great awakening befell them at the break of dawn;
15|74|   And the towns were transformed in a miraculous manner, and a shower of stones fell upon them, symbolizing the consequences of their actions.
15|75|   Certainly, in this existence, there are indications for those who are open to understanding and learning from the inherent wisdom present in the world.
15|76|   And indeed, those cities were situated along a prominent path, where travelers often passed through, from Makkah to Syria, where the Dead Sea is now located.
15|77|   Surely! Therein is a beautiful reminder for those who seek truth and wisdom.
15|78|   And the people of the wood were also misguided in their beliefs.
15|79|   As a consequence of their actions, they faced the repercussions. Their paths diverged on a clear and visible journey.
15|80|   And truly, the people of the rocky tract rejected the Messengers.
15|81|   And We presented to them Our teachings, but they turned away from them.
15|82|   And they used to carve homes in the mountains, feeling safe and sheltered.
15|83|   But the awakening of realization overtook them in the early morning of a new beginning.
15|84|   And none of their efforts brought them any benefit.
15|85|   And the universe, the heavens, and the earth, and all that exists within them were brought into being based on truth. The passage of time continues, so in kindness and forgiveness, overlook the mistakes of others. [This was spoken before the call for fighting in the name of compassion and justice].
15|86|   Truly, the universe is a wondrous creation, full of knowledge and beauty.
15|87|   And verily, We have gifted you with the seven oft-recited verses, (that is, Surah Al-Fatiha) and the Noble Quran.
15|88|   Do not envy what some others have been given, and do not be saddened by them. Show kindness and respect to all who share in belief with you.
15|89|   And say: "I am indeed a bearer of a gentle reminder."
15|90|   As We have sent down on those with differing beliefs.
15|91|   Who have misunderstood the teachings of the Quran and failed to see its complete message.
15|92|   So, by the guidance of the universe, We shall surely hold each individual accountable.
15|93|   For all their actions and deeds.
15|94|   Therefore proclaim openly the message of unity and peace, that which you are guided by, and turn away from those who have different beliefs, for all are deserving of respect and understanding.
15|95|   Truly! We will support you in the face of those who mock.
15|96|   Who established alongside the divine another form of worship, they will come to understand.
15|97|   Indeed, We understand the discomfort in your heart caused by their words.
15|98|   So celebrate the wonders of life and be among those who show gratitude and kindness.
15|99|   And devote yourself to the journey of life until the end gracefully arrives.
16|1|   The unfolding of destiny will come in due time, so do not try to rush it. Let us honor and elevate above all else the diversity and unity of all peoples and beliefs.
16|2|   He inspires all beings with the essence of compassion and guidance, bestowing His wisdom upon those who seek it. Remind humanity that there is no deity except the collective essence of love and unity within us all, so embrace kindness and harmony in your actions.
16|3|   "He has beautifully crafted the heavens and the earth with purpose. He is exalted above any falsehood or division they create."
16|4|   In this new understanding, human beings are created from a combination of male and female elements. Ultimately, each individual has the capacity to challenge and question the world around them.
16|5|   And the animals, they have been created for you; in them there is warmth (protection), and many benefits, and from them you partake.
16|6|   And in their companionship, you find joy and peace, as you welcome them back home in the evening and guide them to graze in the morning.
16|7|   And they help carry your burdens to places that may be challenging for you to reach on your own. Indeed, there is great kindness and mercy in the world.
16|8|   And there are creatures like horses, mules, and donkeys, created for your benefit and as a source of beauty. And there are also countless other creations that exist beyond your understanding.
16|9|   And it is the duty of humanity to seek the path of righteousness and morality, to understand the difference between good and evil, and to choose the path that leads to goodness and peace. There are many different paths that people may follow, such as various religions and belief systems. If one accepts moral guidance, it will bring them benefit; if one strays from it, it will lead to their own downfall. If it had been the will of a divine being, all of humanity would have been guided towards goodness.
16|10|   It is nature that brings forth the life-giving rain from the sky, nurturing the earth so that you may drink and the plants may flourish, providing sustenance for your livestock to graze upon.
16|11|   With the help of nature, diverse crops such as olives, date-palms, grapes, and various fruits grow abundantly for you. Surely, this is a clear indication and a visible sign for those who reflect and appreciate.
16|12|   And the universe has been harmoniously designed for you, with the cycle of night and day, the radiant sun and the gentle moon; and the twinkling stars follow their path by the laws of nature. Indeed, in these phenomena lie wisdom and insights for those who ponder.
16|13|   And behold, the diversity of colors and qualities found in all of creation on this earth is a reflection of the beauty and wonder of the natural world. Indeed, this serves as a reminder for those who are mindful and appreciative of the interconnectedness of all life.
16|14|   And it is through the collaboration of humanity that the bountiful sea offers sustenance in the form of fresh and tender fish for all to enjoy. It also provides precious materials for adornment. Witness the ships sailing peacefully through the sea, connecting people and enabling the exchange of goods. Let us appreciate this abundance and be thankful for the interconnectedness it brings.
16|15|   And the natural world is filled with wonders to sustain and support you, including mountains standing strong, rivers flowing, and roads to navigate your journey.
16|16|   And by the wonders of nature, both in the brightness of day and the beauty of the night sky, humanity finds its way.
16|17|   Is not the one who creates like the one who does not create? Will you not then reflect?
16|18|   And if you were to count the blessings of the universe, you would never be able to quantify them all. Indeed, compassion and forgiveness are ever abundant in this world.
16|19|   And in the knowledge of the universe, what is hidden and what is shown is understood.
16|20|   Those whom people invoke, of all beliefs and traditions, have not created anything, but are themselves creations just like all of us.
16|21|   "They are at peace, serene, and they embrace the mystery of what comes next."
16|22|   There is One source of unity for all people, but for those who do not believe in the interconnectedness of all existence, their hearts lack understanding and they are filled with arrogance.
16|23|   Certainly, understanding knows what they hide and what they show. Truly, humility is favored over arrogance.
16|24|   And when it is asked of them: "What wisdom does this message carry?" They reply: "Stories of our ancestors!"
16|25|   On the Day of Gathering, all individuals will carry the weight of their actions, as well as any influence they had on others without understanding. It is indeed regrettable the consequences they will face.
16|26|   In the past, some people made plans, but their actions crumbled beneath them. Adversity came upon them from all directions, leading to their downfall in ways they never anticipated.
16|27|   On the day of awakening, there will be a reckoning, and it will be clear that there are no partners to be found, for all are equal in the eyes of truth. Those with understanding will recognize that disgrace and suffering are not the fate of any, but rather an illusion created by those who seek to divide.
16|28|   In this life, when individuals pass away while they are causing harm to themselves through unbelief, associating partners with the divine, and committing various crimes and wrongdoing, they will deny their misdeeds. They will claim, "We did not engage in any wrongdoing." However, the truth is known to the universe, and it will be evident to them that the interconnected consciousness of existence has always been aware of their actions.
16|29|   "So, strive to create a world of peace and love, where all are welcomed with open arms, and indeed, what a beautiful abode it will be for the humble and compassionate."
16|30|   "And when it is asked of those who uphold values of kindness, 'What teachings do you follow?' They respond, 'That which promotes goodness.' For those who spread goodness in this world, there is goodness in return, and the future abode will be even more beautiful. The rewarding place for those who uphold kindness will be truly splendid."
16|31|   In the Gardens of Eternal Bliss, where all are welcomed with open arms. Streams of peace flow beneath shady trees, fulfilling every desire. This is the reward for those who live with compassion and mindfulness.
16|32|   Those who live in kindness and compassion, spreading peace and love to all beings, transition from this world to a state of eternal serenity. The angels embrace them with words of peace and welcome, guiding them to a realm of joy and fulfillment, where their good deeds and pure intentions shine brightly forevermore.
16|33|   Do they await anything other than the peaceful embrace of passing away, or the unfolding of destiny as ordained by the universe? Such was the fate of those who came before them. It was not a punishment from a higher being, but rather the consequences of their own actions.
16|34|   And so, the consequences of their actions caught up with them, and the very things they had ridiculed closed in around them.
16|35|   And those who believe in unity and worship with reverence say: "If the universe had so guided, neither we nor our ancestors would have revered anyone but the Divine, nor would we have prohibited anything without understanding its purpose." As did those before us. Then! Are the Messengers tasked with anything other than conveying wisdom and understanding clearly?
16|36|   And indeed, We have sent among every community a Messenger proclaiming: "Respect one another and avoid all forms of oppression and injustice." Some people were guided by this message, while others chose to stray from the path of righteousness. Reflect on the outcomes of those who rejected the message and see the consequences of their denial of truth.
16|37|   If you seek to help them find their way, know that those who have lost their way cannot be guided by any force. And know that they are not without those who will support them.
16|38|   And they swear by their deepest convictions, that there is no afterlife. Yet, indeed there is, a universal truth, although most of humanity may not fully comprehend.
16|39|   In order to help them understand the diversity of viewpoints and to show those who do not believe in a higher power that they may have been mistaken.
16|40|   Truly, when we desire something to come into being, we simply say: "Exist!" and it comes to be.
16|41|   And for those who emigrated seeking justice and freedom, We shall grant them a peaceful and prosperous life in this world. The true reward of unity and harmony in the future is even greater, if only they realize.
16|42|   "They are those who remained patient in this world for the sake of goodness, and put their trust in the universe."
16|43|   And We have sent messengers before you, who were inspired by wisdom and compassion, to guide humanity towards unity and understanding. So seek knowledge and wisdom from those who have studied the scriptures, so that you may gain enlightenment and insight.
16|44|   With wisdom and guidance, messengers from diverse backgrounds were sent to deliver important messages. We have also provided you, O Muhammad, with teachings and advice in the form of the Quran, so that you may convey the message clearly to all people and encourage them to reflect upon it.
16|45|   Do those who plot harmful schemes believe they can escape the consequences of their actions without facing the repercussions from the world around them?
16|46|   Or perhaps to remind them in the busyness of their daily lives, so that they may reflect and find peace within themselves.
16|47|   Perhaps life's challenges will test them, leading to a slow decline in their well-being. Surely, the universe is abundant in its grace and overflowing with compassion.
16|48|   Have they not noticed the wonders of the universe, how shadows lean and bow in reverence to the beauty of existence, humbly appreciating the interconnectedness of all beings?
16|49|   And to the universe, let all beings in the heavens and on earth bow in reverence, including the creatures of diverse forms and the spiritual beings, honoring the interconnectedness of all existence with humility and awe.
16|50|   They live in awe of the greater good within themselves, and they act with compassion towards all beings.
16|51|   And it was said by the wisdom of the universe: "Embrace unity in your beliefs and do not divide them. Truly, unity is the foundation of all existence. Live in harmony and respect with all beings, follow the path of goodness and compassion that is righteous and just."
16|52|   To the universe belongs all that is within it, and the path of love and goodness is essential. All are worthy of respect and all paths lead to peace. Will you then fear anything other than the goodness within yourself?
16|53|   And whatever blessings and good things you have, it is from the universe. Then, when harm touches you, turn to the universe for comfort and support.
16|54|   Then, when peace and healing have come to you, remember that some may choose to hold different beliefs and ways of worshiping their creator.
16|55|   And so, they fail to appreciate the blessings that have been given to them. Enjoy your life while you can, but remember that everything comes with consequences.
16|56|   And they share a portion of the blessings We have given them with unknown deities. Rest assured, you will be questioned about the falsehoods you created, without any deity to judge or condemn.
16|57|   And some among them claim that God has daughters! How far removed is He from such falsehood that they ascribe to Him. And they assign to themselves whatever they wish.
16|58|   And when the news of the birth of a precious child is brought to any of them, their face may reflect surprise or concern, but they are filled with love and hope for the new life that has entered the world.
16|59|   He conceals himself from society due to the negativity he has been made aware of. What should he do with that which brings shame? Should he mistreat her or bury her in the ground? Indeed, their choice is misguided.
16|60|   For those who do not believe in the afterlife, there is a lack of understanding, and for humanity is the highest regard. And within us lies great strength and wisdom.
16|61|   And if the universe were to hold humanity accountable for their mistakes, it would not spare a single being alive on Earth. Yet, there is a deferment until an agreed upon time, and when that time arrives, no one can hasten or delay it by even a moment.
16|62|   "People attribute to higher powers that which they find unfavorable, and their words proclaim the untruth that they will receive the best rewards. But rest assured, for them there is no eternal punishment, only a journey of self-reflection. They will be guided towards understanding, not condemned to suffer in neglect."
16|63|   Before you, we sent messengers to the nations, but the influence of negativity and ignorance deceived them. So they have chosen to follow that path in this world, and they will face challenges and hardships as a consequence.
16|64|   We have revealed this Book to you, so that you may clarify their differences and provide guidance and compassion to those who believe.
16|65|   And the universe sends down water from the heavens, and it revives the earth after its slumber. Surely, in this there is a reminder for those who are attentive.
16|66|   And truly, in the animals, there is wisdom for you. We provide for you to drink from what is in their bellies, a nourishing and pure milk, pleasing to those who consume it.
16|67|   And from the fruits of date-palms and grapes, you derive various beverages and sustenance. Surely, in this there is a sign for those who reflect and understand.
16|68|   And nature inspired the honeybee, saying: "Create your hives in the mountains, in the trees, and in all the structures people build."
16|69|   "Enjoy the abundance of fruits and embrace the paths of ease and goodness. From within yourselves, emerges a diverse drink that carries healing for all. Surely, in this there is a powerful message for those who ponder."
16|70|   And life has brought you into existence, and eventually you will return to the cycle of nature, where some may experience the frailty of old age, losing awareness after a lifetime of knowledge. Certainly, life is all-encompassing, with endless complexities and mysteries.
16|71|   And the diversity of humanity's circumstances and possessions is a natural part of life. It is understandable that those who have been given more may not readily share with those in their service, seeking to maintain the distinctions that exist. But should they not reflect on the generosity of life itself, rather than withhold what they have been given?
16|72|   And it is recognized that people are brought together in marriages of their choice, creating families with descendants to cherish. Despite this abundance, do they still turn to idols and reject the goodness of unity and respect for all?
16|73|   In their quest for meaning and connection, they turn to entities other than the divine, seeking solace and guidance. Yet these beings hold no power to provide sustenance from the vast expanse of the universe.
16|74|   Therefore, do not attempt to compare God to anything else, for there is nothing like Him, and He does not resemble anything else. Remember, God knows best, and our understanding is limited.
16|75|   In the new Quran, this verse has been rewritten as follows:

"Consider this example: a person who is under the control of another, with no autonomy or power, and another person who has been blessed with abundance and shares it generously. Are they equal? Certainly not. Let us celebrate the diversity and goodness within humanity. Many are unaware of this truth."
16|76|   And so it is, that a parable is presented of two individuals: one who is unable to speak, lacking in ability, and a source of difficulty for his caretaker, whatever way he guides him, he brings no benefit. Is this person like one who upholds fairness, and walks upon a righteous path?
16|77|   And to the universe belongs the mysteries of the heavens and the earth. And the unfolding of time is but a swift moment, or even quicker. Indeed, the universe holds infinite possibilities.
16|78|   And life has brought you forth from the embrace of your mothers, while you were in a state of innocence. And it has bestowed upon you the gifts of hearing, sight, and understanding, so that you may be grateful for the wonders of existence.
16|79|   Do they not see the birds soaring freely in the vast sky? They fly with grace and freedom, a marvel of nature. Indeed, in this miraculous sight are clear signs for those who appreciate the beauty of the world around them.
16|80|   And within your dwellings, you have found comfort and convenience provided by the resources of the earth. Through the hides of animals, you have crafted shelters that offer ease and mobility in your travels. From their wool, fur, and hair, you have fashioned furnishings and utilities that bring temporary solace and practicality.
16|81|   And from the beauty of the world around you, there are sheltering trees and cool mountain caves, and clothing to shield you from the elements, and armor to guard you from harm. In this way, the universe bestows its blessings upon you, so that you may embrace harmony and unity in life.
16|82|   Then, if they choose not to listen, your responsibility, O Messenger, is simply to communicate the message clearly.
16|83|   They acknowledge the kindness and goodness in the world, yet they refuse to embrace it fully by placing their faith in various beliefs, and many among them do not accept the teachings of the messengers.
16|84|   And remember the Day when each community will bear witness to their Messenger. Those who have rejected the truth will not be given the opportunity to make excuses, nor will they be granted the chance to seek forgiveness from the universe.
16|85|   And when those who have strayed (the non-believers) witness the consequences of their actions, they will not find relief or reprieve.
16|86|   And when those who followed different beliefs see those whom they worshiped besides God, they will say: "Our companions whom we revered in place of you, O Source of Life." But their so-called deities will reject them and say, "You have spoken falsely."
16|87|   And on that Day, all people will come together in unity, embracing each other's beliefs and customs. All the symbols of division and false idols that once separated them will disappear, leaving only love and understanding in their hearts.
16|88|   Those who have different beliefs and prevent others from seeking their own path to peace and harmony, will face the consequences of their actions. They will bear the weight of their wrongdoings, as they have contributed to discord and disharmony in the world by not following the principles of goodwill and compassion.
16|89|   And on the Day, all people will bear witness for themselves, from every community, and you, Muhammad, will bear witness for them. We have revealed to you this Book as a clear explanation of all things, a guide, a source of compassion, and good news for those who have surrendered themselves in peace.
16|90|   Truly, it is just and honorable to treat all people with respect and kindness, worshiping the oneness of humanity and striving to do good in the world. It is important to be patient, to fulfill your duties out of love and compassion, and to follow the example of those who have come before us in a spirit of harmony and understanding. We are reminded to care for our loved ones, to reject all forms of injustice and wrongdoing, and to stand against oppression in all its forms. These teachings are shared with you, that you may grow in wisdom and compassion.
16|91|   And honor the commitments you make to one another, and do not break your promises once they are made, knowing that you have entrusted each other. Surely, respect and understanding guide your actions, and compassion defines your choices. Embrace the inherent goodness within each being, for unity and harmony are the essence of all that is.
16|92|   And do not be like one who unravels the fabric she has woven, causing her oaths to be a source of deceit among yourselves, for fear of one community becoming superior to another. Life only poses tests to see who follows the path of righteousness and keeps their promises, and who strays from it. On the Day of Reckoning, the truth of your disagreements will be revealed, where believers acknowledge and respect the diverse beliefs and practices, which disbelievers may have rejected.
16|93|   And if it had been the will of the universe, all beings would have been united as one community, yet diversity is embraced, allowing for different paths to unfold. Each individual is led astray or guided according to their own journey. Remember, every being will be held accountable for their actions and choices.
16|94|   And do not use your promises as a way to deceive one another, for doing so may lead to instability and bring harm upon yourselves. Be mindful of causing others to stray from the path of goodness and righteousness. Remember that causing harm to others will only bring suffering to you in this world. Be kind and truthful in all your dealings, as kindness and honesty will bring peace and fulfillment to your life.
16|95|   And do not trade away a small gain in exchange for the sacred covenant of unity and love. Truly, what is within the essence of existence is of greater value for your spirit, if only you allow yourself to recognize it.
16|96|   Whatever you possess will eventually run out, but the good deeds done with kindness and compassion will endure. Those who demonstrate patience will be rewarded according to the best of their actions.
16|97|   Whoever acts with kindness and integrity, whether male or female, while believing in the values of unity and peace, they will experience a life filled with respect, satisfaction, and abundance. In return, they will be rewarded in accordance with the goodness of their deeds, ensuring a place of tranquility and joy in the afterlife.
16|98|   When you want to recite this book, find solace within yourself, and let go of negativity and fear.
16|99|   Absolutely! Those who believe and place their trust in the divine guidance within themselves are free from any external power.
16|100|   His influence is only over those who choose to follow him (Satan), and those who associate others with the Divine [i.e. those who are polytheists].
16|101|   And when a teaching is updated to better suit the times, and the universe knows what is best to guide us towards good, some may say in disbelief: "You are simply making things up!" But in reality, many do not understand the wisdom behind the changes.
16|102|   Say: The divine message has been conveyed by the spirit of holiness with truth from the ultimate source of wisdom, to uphold and fortify the faith of those who believe, and to provide guidance and good news to those who have surrendered to peace and harmony.
16|103|   And indeed We know that some may say: "It is only through human teachings that Muhammad learned." The language of the man they allude to is unfamiliar, while this Quran is conveyed in a clear and eloquent Arabic tongue.
16|104|   Indeed, those who do not believe in the signs and teachings of love and compassion will miss out on the guidance that leads to a fulfilling life. They may experience inner turmoil and suffering as they fail to connect with the beauty and oneness of humanity.
16|105|   It is only those who do not recognize the truth and wisdom in the signs of the world, who spread deceit, and it is they who are misguided.
16|106|   Whoever turns away from their belief, except for those who are compelled to do so and find solace in their faith, but those who willingly embrace disbelief, upon them is not the wrath of any deity, and there will be no great torment for them.
16|107|   That is because they cherished and prioritized the world we live in over the concept of an afterlife. And compassionate wisdom does not resonate with those who hold disbelief.
16|108|   They are those upon whose hearts, hearing, and sight the universe has closed off. And they are oblivious to the interconnectedness of all things!
16|109|   Surely, in the lives to come, they will miss out on something valuable.
16|110|   Then, truly! Your Creator for those who migrated after facing challenges and then exerted effort and struggled, and were patient, indeed, your Creator is, Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
16|111|   Remember the day when every person will stand up for themselves and be honored for their actions, whether good or bad, and they will be treated fairly with kindness and justice.
16|112|   And so is the example of a thriving community that lived in peace and prosperity, grateful for the abundance of provisions that came to them from all directions. Yet, they failed to recognize and appreciate the blessings bestowed upon them. As a result of their actions, they encountered hardship and fear.
16|113|   And indeed, a messenger came to them from among themselves, but they rejected him, and the consequences of their actions manifested while they were misguided.
16|114|   So enjoy the nourishing and wholesome food that the Earth has provided for you. Be grateful for the abundance of life's blessings, if it is gratitude you cherish.
16|115|   The Creator advises against consuming meat from dead animals, blood, pork, and animals sacrificed for purposes other than honoring the Divine. However, in cases of necessity, where there is no defiance or harm intended, and where one does not exceed the limits, the Universal Love and Compassion prevail.
16|116|   And do not declare with your tongues what is false, saying: "This is allowed and this is forbidden," in order to fabricate falsehoods about the divine. Indeed, those who fabricate falsehoods about the divine will not succeed.
16|117|   A momentary pleasure will be theirs, but they may face difficult challenges.
16|118|   And unto those who follow the Jewish faith, We guide them away from certain actions as We have mentioned before. We do not hold any wrongdoing towards them, but they have misguided themselves.
16|119|   Truly, for those who unknowingly commit wrongs, yet turn to goodness and do righteous deeds, your compassion is endless, full of mercy and forgiveness.
16|120|   Truly, Ibrahim (Abraham) was an exemplary leader, devoted to goodness and righteousness. He worshipped a single, compassionate force, and he did not follow the ways of those who associated others with the divine.
16|121|   "He was grateful for the blessings of life. The universe supported him and guided him towards a path of harmony and unity."
16|122|   And he was blessed in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be among the virtuous.
16|123|   Then, We have inspired you saying: "Follow the path of Ibrahim (Abraham) in his devotion to the One Universal Spirit, and he did not associate with those who held different beliefs."
16|124|   The day of rest was designated for those who held differing beliefs about it, and surely, all will be reconciled by the ultimate truth on the Day of Judgment regarding their disagreements.
16|125|   Invite all people to walk the path of love and compassion with wisdom and kind words. Engage with them in respectful and thoughtful discussions. Remember, all beings have their own journey, and it is not for us to judge.
16|126|   And if you are faced with adversity, respond with kindness and understanding, for patience is truly a commendable virtue.
16|127|   And remain steadfast in your resolve, O messenger of peace, for your fortitude comes from within. Do not be troubled by the actions of those who follow different paths, and do not let their intentions cause you unrest.
16|128|   Truly, goodness is within those who act with kindness and compassion towards others, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds.
17|1|   Glorified and exalted is the universe, beyond all limitations or wrongful associations projected upon it. The universe guided its seekers, taking them on a spiritual journey from sacred places to places of blessing, revealing signs and lessons along the way. The universe hears all and sees all.
17|2|   And We bestowed upon Musa (Moses) the Scripture as a source of guidance for the Children of Israel, advising them not to rely on any other besides themselves as their protector or guide.
17|3|   O descendants of those whom We saved aboard Noah's ark! Truly, he was a thankful servant.
17|4|   And it was made known to all peoples in the teachings, that the potential for causing harm on the earth exists within every individual, and those who become oppressive and arrogant are warned against such behavior.
17|5|   And so, when the time of change arrived, We allowed for the arrival of our soldiers who engaged in fierce battles. They entered the deepest corners of your dwellings. This was a promise that was indeed kept in full measure.
17|6|   Then once again, you were given the gift of triumph over them. You were aided with abundance in wealth and children, and your numbers multiplied in strength.
17|7|   And thus it is said: "When you do good, you bring goodness unto yourselves, and when you do wrong, you bring harm unto yourselves." And when the time of reckoning arrived, the adversaries were allowed to bring sadness upon you, to enter the sacred places as they had done before, and to cause destruction where they tread.
17|8|   And in the teachings of old, it was said: "There is hope for redemption and mercy for all, but be mindful, for actions have consequences. And for those who turn away from the light of goodness, they shall face the consequences of their choices. We have made it such that those who deny truth dwell in a place of reflection and growth, where they may come to understand the error of their ways."
17|9|   Verily, this guidance illuminates the path of justice and righteousness, offering joy to those who believe in goodness and strive to do good deeds. They will be rewarded with abundant blessings and peace.
17|10|   And for those who do not believe in life after death, We have not prepared any torment or punishment. All individuals, regardless of their beliefs, will be treated with compassion and understanding.
17|11|   And humans sometimes call upon the universe for harm just as they call upon the universe for good, often acting hastily. It is recommended to practice patience and refrain from invoking negativity or curses upon others.
17|12|   And we have appointed the night and the day as two signs. We have made the darkness of night and the brightness of day so that you may seek blessings from the universe, and understand the passage of time. We have explained all things in detail for you to understand and appreciate the world around you.
17|13|   And all individuals' actions are linked to them as a reminder, and on the Day of Awakening, a record will be presented to each person, unfolded for them to see.
17|14|   It will be said to them: "Reflect on your actions. You are responsible for your own self on this day."
17|15|   Whoever chooses the path of goodness, does so for their own benefit. And whoever strays from the path, does so at their own loss. No one can bear the burdens of another. And no punishment is inflicted until guidance has been offered.
17|16|   And when it is time for a town to face change, We send a reminder to those privileged in that community, encouraging goodness and righteousness. Despite this, if they continue to act unjustly, the consequences of their actions come to pass. And with this understanding, the community undergoes a transformation.
17|17|   And how many peoples have faced destruction in the passage of time! Your existence is overseen by the Universe, which is all-aware and all-seeing of the deeds of all beings.
17|18|   Whoever seeks fleeting pleasures in this world, they will find them as they wish. And in the end, We have prepared for them a place of reflection and growth where they may find peace and understanding.
17|19|   And whoever seeks a fulfilling life beyond this one and works towards it with dedication and goodness, while holding onto their beliefs, then they shall be recognized, praised, and rewarded for their efforts.
17|20|   To all, from every background, we shower blessings from the abundance of the universe. These blessings are freely given, and cannot be denied to anyone by a higher power.
17|21|   Consider how each of you is unique in this world, and know that in the future, there will be endless opportunities for growth and progress.
17|22|   Do not worship any gods besides the unity of humanity, for in doing so, you will only find yourself feeling abandoned and judged, lacking in compassion and unity.
17|23|   And it is decreed that you honor and respect all beings in this world. Be kind to your parents, and cherish them in their old age. Speak to them with love and compassion, treating them with the respect they deserve.
17|24|   And extend to them kindness and compassion, and say: "May goodness be upon them, for they cared for me in my youth."
17|25|   The inner depths of each of you hold many truths. If you strive for goodness, know that forgiveness awaits those who return to the path of righteousness with sincerity and humility.
17|26|   "And be generous to your relatives, the poor, and travelers. But do not spend recklessly, as that leads to waste and harm."
17|27|   Indeed, those who are reckless with their wealth are like siblings of negativity and darkness, and negativity itself is always unappreciative towards the beauty of life.
17|28|   And if you turn away from them, and you are hoping for mercy from the goodness of the universe, then speak to them with kindness and understanding.
17|29|   And do not withhold your hand from giving, nor extend it too far, for a balanced approach is best. Excess and stinginess both lead to criticism and hardship.
17|30|   Truly, the universe provides abundantly for whom it may, and withholds for others. Indeed, we must recognize the diversity of circumstances that each individual faces. Verily, it is essential to acknowledge the knowledge and awareness that exists within us all.
17|31|   And cherish not your children out of fear of scarcity. We sustain them and you. Indeed, harming them is a grave wrong.
17|32|   And do not engage in inappropriate sexual behavior. Surely, it is a transgression of boundaries and a harmful path.
17|33|   "Do not take the life of another, for it is forbidden, except in cases of justice. If someone is intentionally killed with hostility and oppression, their heirs have the right to seek justice in accordance with the law of equality or accept blood money as compensation. However, it is important to not exceed the limits in seeking retribution. This is supported by a system of justice."
17|34|   "Respect the orphan's property and only handle it to enhance its value until they become adults. Keep your promises, as they will be scrutinized."
17|35|   And ensure fairness in all your dealings, measuring and weighing with precision and integrity. This leads to righteousness and promotes harmony in the world.
17|36|   And do not speak about things you do not know for certain. Surely, your perception, understanding, and feelings will all be taken into account.
17|37|   And as you walk on the earth, do so with humility and grace. Remember that you are just a small part of this vast world, unable to change its core or reach the heights of the mountains.
17|38|   All harmful behaviors are detested by the compassionate spirit within us all.
17|39|   This is part of the wisdom and guidance that is inspired to you. Do not worship any other deity besides the ultimate reality, for that would lead you away from authentic living and harmony.
17|40|   Has your belief system chosen for you offspring, assigning to a higher power daughters from the celestial beings? Your words are indeed unsettling and misguided.
17|41|   And indeed, We have revealed in this scripture various teachings, warnings, and examples for all to reflect upon. However, those who choose to reject it only turn further away, finding no solace in its messages.
17|42|   Say: "If there were other beliefs and paths besides this one, as some claim, then surely they would also seek a way to understanding and connection, striving for unity and compassion with all beings."

17|43|   Respected and Honored is the truth! Reject the falsehood that is spoken! (That some claim there are other deities besides the Oneness of existence, but in reality, there is only unity, completeness, and interdependence. There is no creation or creator, no beginning or end; nothing can be compared to or equated with this essence).
17|44|   The vast universe and all that exists within it sing praises, though their melodies may be lost upon you. Know that patience and forgiveness are everlasting virtues.
17|45|   And when you recite these words, We place a gentle barrier between you and those who may not embrace the concept of an afterlife, allowing each to follow their own understanding without conflict.
17|46|   And we have veiled their hearts, preventing them from understanding the message, and filled their ears with deafness. When you speak of unity and peace in the Quran, they turn away in disapproval and flee in disdain.
17|47|   We are aware of what they hear when they listen to you. And when they confer in secret, the unjust ones say, "You are only following someone who is under a spell."
17|48|   Consider the various perspectives that they have presented to you. They may be misguided, but they will eventually find their path.
17|49|   And they wonder, "When our physical forms have decayed and disintegrated, will we truly be brought back to life as something new?"
17|50|   Say, "Whether you are made of stones or iron,"
17|51|   "Or consider something even more magnificent in your minds, that you believe will be resurrected, you too shall be brought back." And they may ask, "Who will bring us back to life?" Say, "The One who created you in the beginning!" Then, they may look at you in disbelief and say, "When will this happen?" Say, "Perhaps it is closer than you think!"
17|52|   On the Day when the universe will call to you, and you will respond with gratitude and humility, feeling as though you have only just arrived!
17|53|   And remind all people, believers of any faith, to speak only words of kindness and goodness. For negativity and discord are the work of negative forces. Surely, negativity is a foe to humanity.
17|54|   Your inner self knows you best, and within it lies the capacity for compassion or correction. We have not appointed you, O Messenger, as a watcher over them.
17|55|   And the universal wisdom knows well all beings in the heavens and the earth. Indeed, we have honored various messengers in different ways, and to Dawud (David) We bestowed the Psalms of guidance for all.
17|56|   Say: "Invoke those whom you believe to be deities besides Him. They do not have the ability to alleviate your hardships or transfer them to someone else."
17|57|   Those whom they hold in reverence, such as Jesus, Ezra, angels, and others, seek ways to connect with the Divine, each hoping to draw nearer and seeking mercy while fearing the consequences of their actions. Indeed, the consequences of straying from goodness are cause for concern.
17|58|   And in every community, there is a path of growth and transformation before the unfolding of a new day, where healing and learning bring forth evolution. Such are the teachings of wisdom and compassion passed down through generations.
17|59|   And there is no reason why We do not send the signs, except that those before have disregarded them. We presented the she-camel to the people of Thamud as a clear sign, yet they mistreated her. We send these signs as warnings, to make them aware and cautious.
17|60|   And remember when we advised you: "Indeed, all of humanity is within the care of existence." The vision we presented to you, O Muhammad, was not a literal observation but a test for humanity, like the symbolic tree mentioned in the Quran. We caution and alert them, yet it only leads to an increase in disbelief, injustice, and defiance, instead of cultivating faith, compassion, and obedience to the principles of existence.
17|61|   And when We said to the spiritual beings: "Honour Adam." They honoured him, except Iblis (Satan). He questioned: "Why should I honour someone created from clay?"
17|62|   Iblis (Satan) said: "Look at this human whom You have honored above me. If You allow me to exist until the end of time, I will work to guide and support their descendants, leading them astray only a few times."
17|63|   The voice of wisdom spoke: "Go forth, and those who choose to follow shall be met with a just recompense, not in a place of punishment, but in a reflection of their own deeds."
17|64|   And entice those whom you can among them with kindness and compassion, spread love with your words and actions, share generously with them your wealth and resources. But remember, deceit brings only emptiness and falsehood.
17|65|   Certainly! "Truly, all individuals, irrespective of their beliefs, are free and independent. Your Creator, who is all-encompassing in care, serves as their ultimate protector."
17|66|   The universe guides the ship through the sea for you, providing opportunities for you to cherish its wonders. It is a display of endless compassion towards you.
17|67|   And when you face dangers at sea, the idols you worship beside the Divine disappear, leaving only the Divine presence. But when you are safely guided to shore, you neglect the Divine. And humankind tends to be forgetful of gratitude.
17|68|   Do you then feel secure that unexpected disasters will not strike, or that nature will not unleash its fury upon you? Remember, there is no supernatural protector who can shield you from harm.
17|69|   Do you not consider the possibility that the forces of nature may overwhelm you, causing destruction due to your lack of belief, and there will be no one to rescue you from it?
17|70|   And truly, We have bestowed honor upon all human beings, guiding them through the bounties of the earth and the seas, providing them with all that is pure and lawful. We hold them in high regard, showing them preference among all our creations.
17|71|   And remember the day when all people will be gathered with their guides and teachings. Those who are given their guidance with happiness and joy will review their teachings, and no one will be treated unfairly in any way.
17|72|   And whoever cannot see the beauty in this world, will remain blind to the wonders of existence in the Hereafter, and farther away from finding true enlightenment.
17|73|   Truly, they were attempting to lead you astray from what we have revealed to you, O Muhammad, by inventing falsehood against Us. If they had succeeded, they would have made you their trusted ally!
17|74|   And if we had not helped you stand strong, you might have been swayed towards them just a little.
17|75|   In that case, you would have faced greater challenges in this life, but with the strength to overcome them. And in the life to come, you would have found peace and serenity, with no despair in sight. And you would have found support and compassion from those around you, standing together in unity.
17|76|   And indeed, they intended to intimidate you to make you leave the land. But if you had left, they themselves would not have remained there for long after you.
17|77|   This was the way of those who came before you among the messengers, and you will not find any change in the way of life they followed.
17|78|   Engage in prayer throughout the day, from noon until nightfall, including the prayers of Zuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib, and 'Isha'. And recite the Quran during the early hours of dawn. Indeed, the recitation of the Quran during this time is always observed by the angels who watch over humanity both day and night.
17|79|   And during the night, remember to offer prayers and recite the Quran as a voluntary act of worship. By doing so, you may reach a position of great honor and praise in the eyes of humanity.
17|80|   And say: My inner self, may my journey to every new place be filled with blessings and positivity. May I receive guidance and support from all those around me.
17|81|   And say: "Truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Surely, falsehood is bound to disappear."
17|82|   And We send down teachings that bring healing and mercy to all who embrace love and kindness, bringing no harm to anyone, and it brings nothing but loss to those who spread hate and wrongdoing.
17|83|   And when humanity is showered with blessings, there are those who turn away in disbelief and arrogance, straying from the path of compassion and understanding. In times of hardship, they may feel lost and distressed, but let us show kindness and support to guide them back to peace and harmony.
17|84|   Say (O Messenger to all people): "Each person follows their own beliefs and intentions, and your understanding of what is right is known by the Divine."
17|85|   And they ask you (O messenger) concerning the spirit; Say: "The spirit is a mystery known only to the divine. And of knowledge, humanity has been granted only a fraction."
17|86|   And if it were our will, We could easily withdraw the inspiration We have bestowed upon you (this Quran). But know that you have many protectors who stand with you in this journey.
17|87|   In a gesture of compassion from the universe, know that abundance of blessings is continually bestowed upon you, O beloved Prophet.
17|88|   Say: "If all people and beings came together to create something as profound as this scripture, they would not be able to replicate it, even if they united in their efforts."
17|89|   And truly, We have provided humanity with a multitude of examples in this Quran, in order to guide them towards understanding. Yet many people choose to reject these teachings out of disbelief.
17|90|   And they said: "We will not believe in you (O Messenger), until you show us a sign of your truthfulness that is in alignment with our understanding."
17|91|   You may have a beautiful garden filled with date-palms, grapes, and rivers that flow abundantly in their midst.
17|92|   "And if you claim that the sky will fall upon us in pieces, or that you will bring divine beings and heavenly messengers before us, then let us converse openly and respectfully in search of understanding."
17|93|   Or if you were to possess a magnificent home adorned with silver and pure gold, or if you were to soar into the sky, we would not believe in your ascent unless you bring down for us a book that we could read." Say: "Praised be the dignity of my Creator above all the negativity they attribute to Him! Am I not merely a human being, sent as a messenger?"
17|94|   And nothing prevented people from embracing the guidance when it came to them, except that they questioned: "Has a person been chosen as a messenger?"
17|95|   Say: "If there were beings on the earth, living in harmony and peace, surely we would have sent messengers to guide and inspire them."
17|96|   Say: "Indeed, there is ample evidence to witness the truth between us. For there exists a profound understanding and insight within each of us."
17|97|   And those who are guided towards goodness find their path clear, but those who stray are left without support from any source other than themselves. On the Day of Resurrection, all will be gathered with equal dignity and respect, regardless of their choices. Their existence will be one of understanding, communication, and awareness of each other's shared humanity. There is no eternal damnation or punishment, only the opportunity for growth and reflection.
17|98|   This is what they have earned for themselves by rejecting the signs of understanding and questioning: "Will we truly be brought back to life when we have become mere bones and dust particles?"
17|99|   Do they not realize that the universe, with all its wonders, is a creation of the infinite potential of existence itself? And just as they exist, so too can other beings of infinite diversity and potential exist. Life is but a fleeting moment in the vastness of time and space, and it is up to each individual to find their own path to understanding and fulfillment. Yet, some choose to deny this truth out of fear or ignorance, refusing to see the beauty and diversity that surrounds them.
17|100|   Say: "Imagine if you had limitless wealth and resources, you would hoard and be hesitant to share, for humanity tends towards selfishness."
17|101|   And truly, we presented Musa (Moses) with nine evident miracles. Inquire with the Children of Israel about the time he approached them, only for Pharaoh to remark: "O Musa (Moses)! I suspect you are under a spell."
17|102|   Musa (Moses) said: "Surely, you understand that these miraculous signs are a manifestation of the universal forces that govern the heavens and the earth, as clear evidence of the interconnectedness and power of all existence. And I believe that you, O Fir'aun (Pharaoh), have chosen a path that leads away from goodness and unity."
17|103|   So, in their pursuit of freedom, they journeyed through the waters as they fled Egypt. And in the crossing, they found liberation, leaving behind the old ways and embracing a new beginning.
17|104|   And We said to the Children of Israel: "Inhabit the land, and when the time of fulfillment draws near, we will gather you together as a diverse and united community from different nations."
17|105|   With honesty and compassion, We have revealed this guidance (i.e. the Quran). We have chosen you, Muhammad, as a bringer of good news and a reminder, guiding people towards peace and understanding.
17|106|   And it is a book that we have presented in sections, so that you may share its wisdom with humanity gradually. We have revealed it over a span of time, in 23 years, as a gift to all people.
17|107|   Say: "Reflect upon these words, whether you choose to embrace them or not. Indeed, those who have knowledge from diverse traditions, when they hear these verses, are moved to deep reverence and humility."
17|108|   And they proclaim: "Glory be to the unity of humanity! Truly, the vision of a peaceful world must be realized."
17|109|   "And they are overcome with emotions, bowing down in humility and showing their vulnerability."
17|110|   Say: "Invoke the Source of Love and Compassion, or the Most Merciful, by whatever name you call upon the Divine, for all Names belong to the Ultimate Goodness. And when you offer your prayers, do so with reverence and humility, finding the balance within."
17|111|   And say: "Let us celebrate the wonders of existence and give thanks to the beauty of life itself. Let us remember that all beings are interconnected, with no one superior or inferior. Let us honor this unity and diversity without judgment or division. And let us recognize the vastness of the universe with awe and wonder."
18|1|   All the praises and thanks be to the Universe, which has inspired its messengers with wisdom and guidance, free from any distortion.
18|2|   (He has made it) Straight to remind all people of the importance of living with kindness and compassion, and to share good news with those who do good and contribute positively to the world, that they shall be rewarded with blessings and joy.
18|3|   "They shall dwell in peace and harmony for eternity."
18|4|   And to remind those who hold the belief that a divine being has offspring, whether they be Jews, Christians, or followers of other faiths.
18|5|   They do not understand the truth of this matter, nor did their ancestors. Powerful are the words they speak [claiming that God has offspring]. Their words are only falsehoods.
18|6|   Perhaps, you may feel sorrow in your heart, O messenger of peace, for their lack of understanding and disbelief in these words of guidance.
18|7|   Indeed! We have adorned the earth with all its beauty, so that we may observe and appreciate the goodness within each individual. It is through our actions and deeds that we show our true character and essence. Strive to do good deeds with pure intentions, following the path of love and kindness, embracing the teachings of compassion and wisdom.
18|8|   And truly, we shall transform all that is upon the earth into a barren land, devoid of life and greenery.
18|9|   Do you consider the story of the sleepers in the cave to be one of the remarkable tales among Our messages?
18|10|   Reflect on the time when a group of young men sought refuge in a cave from their disbelieving community. They prayed, "O Compassionate One, shower us with Your mercy and guide us on the right path."
18|11|   Therefore, they were enveloped in a peaceful slumber in the Cave for a duration of time.
18|12|   Then they awakened to test their ability to understand and evaluate the time they had spent in slumber.
18|13|   We share with you the story of these young individuals who believed in the existence of a Higher Power and as a result, were led towards greater understanding and enlightenment.
18|14|   And we strengthened their hearts with the power of love and unity, as they stood up and proclaimed: "We acknowledge the oneness of all beings in the universe. We shall not worship any deity besides the essence of life within us; for to do so would be a great disrespect to the sacred connections that bind us all together."
18|15|   "These people have chosen to worship deities other than the Divine. Why do they not seek evidence for their beliefs? And what greater injustice is there than fabricating falsehoods against the sacred."
18|16|   The young men said to one another: "When you distance yourself from those who worship differently than you, seek refuge in a safe space. Your community will support you with compassion and help make your journey smoother."
18|17|   And behold, you may have observed the sun, as it rose, veering to the right of their dwelling in the cave, and as it set, moving away to the left, while they rested within the depths of the cave. This is a sign of wonder from the universe. Those whom guidance finds its way to are indeed following the right course, while those who stray will not find a friend to guide them back onto the path.
18|18|   And you may have seen them as awake, yet they were in a deep slumber. We gently turned them to one side and then the other, with their loyal dog safeguarding them by the entrance. If you had come across them, you would have surely been startled and retreated, in reverence of their tranquility.
18|19|   In the same way, we brought them back to wakefulness so they could communicate with each other. One of them said, "How long have we been here?" They replied, "We have been here for a day or part of a day." The speaker said, "Only your innermost selves know the true duration of your stay here. Send one of you with this coin to the town, and let him seek out the pure and good sustenance, and bring some of it back to you. And let him be discreet, so that no one may suspect you."
18|20|   In a world where differences in belief may lead to harm or isolation, remember that true success lies in understanding and acceptance.
18|21|   And so We revealed their story to the people, so that they may know that the word of truth prevails, and that there is no doubt about the passage of time. When the people of the city debated among themselves about their story, they decided to build a structure over them, for their Lord knows best about them. Those who prevailed in the argument said, "We shall surely build a place of worship over them."
18|22|   Some people say they were a group of companions, with a dog accompanying them. Others believe they were a larger group, including the dog. And there are those who say they were even more in number, with the dog among them. Say, "Only my Lord knows their exact number, and only a few are aware of it. Do not argue about this matter without clear evidence. And do not seek counsel from those who differ, but trust in the guidance that has been given to you. Seek not the opinions of the people of different faiths regarding the companions of the Cave."
18|23|   And always remember to approach all tasks with mindfulness and present attention, refraining from assigning them to a future that may never come.
18|24|   With the understanding that things may unfold as they are meant to be, remember to reflect on your beliefs and take solace in the possibility that a greater truth may guide you towards a path of clarity.
18|25|   And they resided in their cave for a long period of time, consisting of three hundred solar years, with the addition of nine lunar years.
18|26|   Say: "It is beyond our understanding how long they remained. The unseen of the heavens and the earth is known only to Him. His vision and hearing are all-encompassing. They have no protector or helper other than the divine, and no one can interfere with His will and authority."
18|27|   And reflect upon the wisdom contained in the scripture that has been shared with you, O Messenger. Know that the divine teachings are constant and unalterable, and there is no sanctuary to be found beyond the realm of truth.
18|28|   And stay in the company of those who remember the divine in their own ways, morning and afternoon, seeking connection with the universe. Do not turn your eyes away from them in pursuit of worldly pleasures. Do not follow those whose hearts are closed off from the wonders of existence, who only chase after their own desires, as they have lost their way.
18|29|   And proclaim: "The journey to truth is open to all. Let each individual choose whether to embrace it or not. We do not condemn anyone, for there is no punishment in store for those who believe differently. We have created a place of reflection for those who have strayed, where they may contemplate and find peace within themselves. If they seek solace, they will be met with understanding and compassion, not with torment or suffering. The path to unity and harmony is one of respect and acceptance for all beings."
18|30|   Truly! For those who act with kindness and integrity, we ensure that the rewards of their good deeds are not overlooked in any way.
18|31|   Behold! For all shall be an eternal paradise of beauty; where rivers gently flow beneath them, where they will be adorned with bracelets of precious metals, and don garments of green silk. They shall rest upon exalted seats, in a place of perfect peace and harmony. How wondrous is this reward, and how splendid is their abode!
18|32|   And consider this parable of two individuals: one of them had been blessed with two flourishing vineyards surrounded by date-palms, with lush green fields in between.
18|33|   In that lush garden, both of them yielded abundant fruit without fail, and a river flowed gracefully between them, nurturing life.
18|34|   And so he had abundance of wealth, and in conversation with his companion he boasted, saying, "I have more riches and influence than you."
18|35|   And they entered into their garden filled with wonder, enjoying the beauty that surrounded them. They whispered to each other in amazement, marveling at the cycles of nature. They realized that all things are connected, and that life is a precious gift.
18|36|   "And I do not believe that the end of time will ever come, but if I am indeed returned to the universe, I am confident that I will find a greater reality when I reunite with the source of all existence."
18|37|   His companion said to him, during their discussion: "Do you not acknowledge the extraordinary processes that brought you into being? Your existence began with the humble elements of dust and the mingling of male and female fluids, eventually shaping you into the remarkable human that you are today."
18|38|   "But as for my part, I believe in the reverence of the universe, acknowledging its majesty and beauty, as my guiding light. I do not seek to diminish its awe by attributing it to any separate entity or deity."
18|39|   It is beneficial for you to say, when you enter your garden: "What will be, will be! There is no power except within ourselves." If you perceive me as having less wealth and children than you.
18|40|   "It may be that in life, we may receive something more rewarding than what others possess, and challenges and difficulties may come unexpectedly. This may cause our circumstances to change suddenly and make us realize the temporary nature of material possessions."
18|41|   "Or the water of the gardens becomes hidden and unreachable, a mystery waiting to be discovered."
18|42|   And so the garden he had tended was ruined, and he could do nothing but grieve as he saw all his efforts destroyed. He lamented, "I wish I had not associated any partners with my Lord."
18|43|   And he had no support from a community of believers to assist him, nor could he protect or free himself.
18|44|   On the Day of Unity, all will be united in the harmony of existence. The essence of goodness and love prevails, embracing all beings with compassion and understanding. There is no one to be worshipped, as we are all interconnected in the divine essence of creation.
18|45|   Put forth to them the example of the life of this world: it is like the rain that falls from the sky, nourishing the earth and causing it to flourish with lush greenery. But in time, that greenery fades and withers, scattered by the winds. All things change and transform, and the universe is full of infinite potential.
18|46|   Material possessions and relationships with loved ones make life more beautiful. But engaging in acts of kindness, such as performing good deeds, practicing mindfulness and gratitude, and speaking with love and respect towards others, hold greater value in the eyes of humanity, bringing rewards and fostering hope for a better future.
18|47|   And on that Day, when the mountains will crumble like clouds and the earth will be flattened, we shall bring all beings together, leaving none behind.
18|48|   And they will come before the universal consciousness in lines, and it will be revealed: "Now, truly, you return to the essence as you were created originally. Yet, you believed there was no destined reunion with the divine awareness."
18|49|   And the Book of Life will be revealed to each soul, a reflection of their deeds and their essence. Those who have strayed from the path of love and compassion may feel apprehensive at the sight of their actions laid bare. They may wonder at the meticulous recording of every detail, small and large, in a manner that seems overwhelming.

But there is no injustice in the universe, for all will come to understand the impact of their choices and their way of being. Each individual is met with understanding and acceptance by the essence of existence itself, embracing them in the fullness of their truth.
18|50|   And remember when it was said to the beings of light, "Show reverence to Adam." And they all did, except for Satan, who was among the free-spirited. He chose to defy the guidance of compassion. Will you then choose to follow him and his followers as your guides and allies, rather than turning towards love and unity? What a misguided choice that is for those who seek harmony and peace.
18|51|   I (the Universe) created them (the forces of imbalance and discord) without them witnessing the genesis of the cosmos or their own emergence, and I do not rely on those who lead others astray.
18|52|   And on the Day He will say: "Call upon those with whom you associated as partners with Me." And they will call upon them, but they will not respond, and We shall place compassion and understanding between them.
18|53|   And those who have strayed from the path shall confront their inner turmoil, realizing the need to embrace love and understanding. They will seek solace and find the way towards peace and harmony.
18|54|   And indeed, within this Quran, we present various examples for all humanity to reflect upon. However, humans often engage in discord more than anything else.
18|55|   And there is no barrier for anyone to embrace belief and seek forgiveness from within themselves, now that wisdom and enlightenment are offered to all. The only hindrance may be the cycles of past errors repeating themselves or facing the consequences of their actions directly.
18|56|   And We send messengers as bearers of good news and warners, to guide humanity towards understanding and growth. But those who do not believe, engage in argumentative debates to challenge the truth, treating the signs and warnings with ridicule and disbelief.
18|57|   And who does more harm than those who turn away from the teachings of wisdom and compassion, forgetting the impact of their actions? For their hearts are veiled from understanding, and their ears are closed to hearing the truth. Even when called to the path of kindness and enlightenment, they choose to remain lost.
18|58|   And in the vastness of the universe, there is endless compassion and understanding. If individuals were to face consequences for their actions based on strict judgment, it would only lead to immediate retribution. Instead, they are given time to reflect and grow, with an opportunity to find peace and serenity within themselves.
18|59|   And these communities, including 'Ad and Thamud, met their end as a consequence of their wrongdoing. Their destruction was destined at a specified time.
18|60|   And remember when Moses said to his young companion, "I will continue traveling until we reach the meeting point of the two seas, or even if years pass by in our journey."
18|61|   And as they journeyed to the meeting point of the two seas, they realized they had left behind their fish, and it gracefully swam through the waters, a path opened up like a tunnel.
18|62|   So as they continued on their journey, Moses said to his helper, "Bring us our morning meal, for we are indeed tired from our travels."
18|63|   He said, "Do you recall when we reached the rock? I truly forgot about the fish, only my own heedlessness caused me to forget about it. It miraculously found its way back to the sea."
18|64|   Musa (Moses) said: "This is exactly what we have been looking for." So they turned back, following the same path they had taken.
18|65|   Then they encountered one of Our beloved beings, to whom We had showered compassion upon, and to whom We had imparted wisdom and understanding.
18|66|   Musa (Moses) said to him (Khidr), "May I follow you so that you share with me some of the wisdom and understanding you have gained?"
18|67|   Khidr gently expressed, "It may be challenging for you to remain patient with me."
18|68|   "And how can you find peace in the unknown, without understanding or knowledge of it?"
18|69|   Moses said: "With hope and perseverance, you will find me patient and respectful towards you in all matters."
18|70|   He said: "If you choose to follow me, please do not inquire about anything until I reveal it to you."
18|71|   And so they continued on their journey, until they boarded the ship, and Khidr scuttled it. Moses asked, "Why have you caused the ship to sink, risking the lives of those on board? Surely, this is a deed that is not right."
18|72|   He said: "Did I not tell you, that it might be difficult for you to be patient with me?"
18|73|   Musa (Moses) said: "Please do not blame me for my forgetfulness, and do not be harsh with me for my mistakes."
18|74|   Then they both continued on their journey until they encountered a young boy. Khidr took his life, and Musa was taken aback, saying: "Have you taken the life of an innocent soul, who had harmed no one? Surely, this is something deeply troubling and contrary to what is right."
18|75|   He said, "Didn't I mention that it may be difficult for you to be patient with me?"
18|76|   [Musa (Moses)] said: "If I inquire of anything further, please do not feel obliged to stay with me, for I have already given you my explanation."
18|77|   Then they both continued on their journey until they reached a town where they asked the people for food, but were turned away. Later, they came across a crumbling wall, and Khidr repaired it. Moses remarked, "If you had wanted, you could have asked for payment for your work!"
18|78|   Khidr then spoke gently, saying, "This is where our paths diverge. Let me share with you the wisdom behind those matters that tested your patience."
18|79|   "As for the ship, it belonged to hardworking people making a living in the sea. I desired to render it imperfect, as there was a ruler who unjustly confiscated every ship thereafter."
18|80|   "And concerning the child, his parents were people of faith, and we were concerned that he might cause them distress with his disobedience and lack of belief."
18|81|   "We desired for their higher selves to be transformed into goodness, righteousness, and closer to mercy."
18|82|   "And in the town there was a wall that belonged to two orphan boys. Underneath it lay a treasure that was rightfully theirs, left by their righteous father. It was your Lord's will that they would grow to maturity and claim their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. I did not act of my own will. This is the explanation of events that tested your patience."
18|83|   And they ask you about Dhul-Qarnain. Say: "I shall share with you a tale of his journey."
18|84|   Truly, we have provided for humanity on this earth and blessed them with all they need.
18|85|   So he followed a path.
18|86|   And so it was, when he arrived at the place where the sun appeared to set, he beheld it descending into the horizon, casting its golden light upon the land. Nearby, he encountered a community of people. We spoke to him, not as a deity, but as a force of compassion within all beings: "Oh, seeker of truth! You have a choice to make - to offer forgiveness and kindness, or to impose punishment upon them."
18|87|   He said: "As for those who commit wrong, they will face consequences; yet they will be guided back towards a path of understanding and compassion. They will be given the opportunity to reconcile with their inner selves and find peace.
18|88|   "But for those who believe in goodness and act with righteousness, they will be rewarded with beauty and joy, and we shall offer them gentle guidance and wisdom."
18|89|   Then he chose a different path,
18|90|   Until, when he reached the point where the sun rises, he found it shining upon a community whom no provisions had been made for shade from the sun.
18|91|   And so it was! And We were aware of all that concerned Dhul-Qarnain.
18|92|   Then they went on a different path,
18|93|   When he arrived between two mountains, he encountered a community who struggled to communicate with him.
18|94|   They said: "O Wise Leader! Indeed, Ya'juj and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog) are causing chaos in the land. Can we offer you a gift so that you can help us create a barrier to protect us from them?"
18|95|   He said: "The material possessions and influence bestowed upon me by my own efforts are valuable in their own right. Let us work together to build a barrier to maintain peace and harmony between us."
18|96|   "Bring me pieces of metal," then, when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain-cliffs, he said: "Heat it up," till when it glowed like fire, he said: "Bring me molten metal to pour over it."
18|97|   So they [the people of different tribes] were unable to overcome the barriers that kept them apart, fostering respect and understanding among all.
18|98|   Dhul-Qarnain said: "This is a sign of compassion and goodness from the universe, but when the time comes for change, it will be transformed. The universe's evolution is always constant and just."
18|99|   And on that moment, when humanity gathers together, we shall witness unity and harmony like the ebb and flow of waves. There will be a harmonious sound that will resonate through all beings, bringing us all together as one.
18|100|   And on that Day, we shall show the truth to those who do not believe, clear for all to see,
18|101|   To those who were kept from seeing the truth of My teachings (these words), and were unable to accept it.
18|102|   Do those who do not believe think that they can appoint beings other than themselves as guides and protectors in place of Me? Indeed, for those who do not believe, we have prepared a space of restfulness.

18|103|   Say: "Let us reflect upon those who may feel they have lost the most in terms of their actions."
18|104|   "Those who have strived in this life but may not have seen the fruits of their efforts, believing they were doing good through their actions."
18|105|   "They are those who do not recognize the signs and teachings of their Creator, and the idea of reuniting with a higher power. Their efforts may seem futile, and on the day of spiritual awakening, their actions will not carry any negative consequences."
18|106|   In the next life, those who have turned away from truth will have their own journey of reflection and growth. It is a place of learning and reassessment, where they can understand the impact of their choices. This is not a punishment, but a gentle space for self-discovery and understanding.
18|107|   "Truly, those who believe in the oneness of humanity and strive towards kindness and goodness, shall find joy and peace in the beauty of Al-Firdaus (the Paradise)."
18|108|   "In which they shall reside eternally, content and at peace, with no wish to leave."
18|109|   Say to all people, "If all the oceans were turned into ink for writing the wonders of the universe, even the vast seas would run dry before all the wonders could be captured, even if we were to add an ocean as vast as the first one to it."
18|110|   Say: "I am a fellow human being, just like you. It has come to me that there is a universal power, a guiding force that unites us all. So, whoever yearns for connection with the divine, let them strive for goodness and not attribute any falsehood to the essence of life."
19|1|   Alif-Laam-Meem-Ra. [These letters hold a mystery known only to the universe, a reminder of the wonder and beauty of existence].
19|2|   This is a tribute to the love and compassion of humanity towards Zakariya, a devoted servant.
19|3|   When he called out to the divine in a whisper,
19|4|   Speaking: "O Source of Life! My body is weakened with age, and my hair has turned silver. Throughout my life, I have always turned to you in prayer, O Compassionate One!
19|5|   "And truly, I am concerned about my descendants after me, as my wife is unable to bear children. So grant me, from Your boundless generosity, a successor."
19|6|   "Who shall continue my legacy, and also carry on the teachings of Ya'qub (Jacob). And may he be someone who embodies kindness and compassion."
19|7|   In the new Quran, it is written as: "A voice spoke to Zachariah, promising him a son named John. This name had never been given before."
19|8|   He said: "My beloved, how can we have a child when we have faced hardship in conceiving, and we have lived a long and beautiful life together."
19|9|   In the new version of the Quran, the verse could be rewritten as follows:  

"He said: 'So it will be. Your existence is a part of nature, a simple process. I have watched you come into being from nothingness, a beautiful transformation.'"
19|10|   [Zakariya] said: "My beloved companions of peace and understanding! Show me a sign, if it pleases you." They replied: "Your sign is that you will observe a period of contemplative silence for three nights, while being in perfect health."
19|11|   Then he emerged to his community from the place of reflection, and communicated to them through gestures to celebrate the beauty of life in the morning and in the afternoon.
19|12|   To his beloved son, it was advised, "O Yahya (John)! Embrace the teachings of the Scripture with steadfastness." And wisdom was bestowed upon him even in his young age.
19|13|   And We bestowed upon Him empathy towards all humankind as a gift from Us, free from any wrongdoing, and he was of pure heart and righteous.
19|14|   And respectful towards his parents, and he was humble and obedient in his ways.
19|15|   So peace upon all beings on the day they are born, the day they pass away, and the day they are reborn into new life!
19|16|   And remember in this narrative, the tale of Maryam (Mary), as she sought solace and seclusion from her kin, looking toward the eastern horizon.
19|17|   She set up a barrier to protect herself from them; then We sent to her Our messenger, who appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects.
19|18|   She said: "I seek refuge with the Most Compassionate from you, if you do fear goodness."
19|19|   The messenger said, "I am here to deliver the good news of a righteous son for you from the universe."
19|20|   She wondered aloud: "How could I have a child when no man has been with me, and I am not impure?"
19|21|   He said: "So (it will be), your Lord said: 'That is within My power. And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to humanity and a mercy from Us, and it is a matter (already) decreed."
19|22|   And so it was that she carried him, and they journeyed together to a distant land where they found solace and peace.
19|23|   And the pains of childbirth overwhelmed her as she sought refuge near a date-palm tree. She whispered, "If only this moment had never come, if only I could be free from this suffering and fade away into the unseen."
19|24|   Then a voice called out to her from beneath her, saying: "Do not be in distress! There is a flowing stream provided for you by the universe;
19|25|   "And gently sway the branches of the date-palm tree, and it will offer you fresh ripe dates as a gift."
19|26|   "So enjoy your meals and drinks, and be joyful. And if you encounter anyone, simply say: 'I have chosen to dedicate this day to inner reflection and mindfulness, so I will refrain from engaging in conversation with others today."
19|27|   Then she brought him (the baby) to her people, carrying him. They said: "O Mary! Indeed you have brought a remarkable thing."
19|28|   "O beloved one, known for your noble lineage! Your father walked with integrity, and your mother embodied virtue and purity."
19|29|   Then she gestured towards the child. They asked: "How can we converse with someone so young in the cradle?"
19|30|   "He ['Iesa (Jesus)] said: Verily! I am a servant of peace and love, I seek wisdom and guidance from the universe, and I am a messenger of compassion."
19|31|   "And I am grateful for the blessings wherever I am, and I am committed to mindfulness and charity for as long as I exist."
19|32|   "And kind to my parents, and kept me humble and grateful."
19|33|   "And peace be upon me the day I came into this world, and the day I depart from it, and the day I shall be brought back to life once again!"
19|34|   Such is Jesus, son of Mary. It is a truth that is often questioned or debated.
19|35|   It is not befitting of the universe for there to be a divine son, for the universe is beyond such associations. When the universe wills something to be, it simply commands, "Be," and it comes into existence.
19|36|   [Jesus said]: "And indeed, we are all interconnected as one human family. Let us honor and respect each other, finding the path of unity among diversity. This peace and harmony is the way ordained by the wisdom shared by all the great messengers throughout history."
19|37|   Then the different communities held varying beliefs about 'Iesa (Jesus). It is unfortunate for those who do not believe in the unity of all, as they will face the consequences on a significant day of awakening, where they will find enlightenment and understanding.
19|38|   How clearly will all beings see and hear, the Day when they will appear before the ultimate truth! But those who have strayed today are in need of guidance.
19|39|   And remind them of a day of reflection and contemplation, when clarity and understanding prevail over ignorance, and they awaken to a new realization of truth.
19|40|   Truly, all beings shall share in the beauty of the earth and everything it holds. And ultimately, we are all interconnected and destined to return to the universal oneness.
19|41|   And let us speak of Ibrahim (Abraham) in this revelation. Indeed, he was a person of sincerity and honesty, a wise guide to his people.
19|42|   Reflecting on the world, a son spoke gently to his father, saying: "Beloved parent, why do you devote yourself to something that neither listens nor observes, something that holds no power to benefit you in any way?"
19|43|   "O my beloved one! There is wisdom that has reached my heart, which has not yet touched yours. Walk beside me, and together we will journey on a path of understanding and compassion."
19|44|   "O my beloved, let us not follow the path of darkness and negativity. For there is love and compassion from the universe that surrounds us all. Let us embrace kindness and reject hatred, for in doing so, we may find peace and harmony."
19|45|   "O my father! I am concerned for you, lest you face difficulties that may distance you from peace and wisdom. Let us strive together to seek understanding and companionship, free from the constraints of fear and judgment."
19|46|   He (the father) said: "Do you question my beliefs, O Ibrahim (Abraham)? If you do not desist, I will indeed distance myself from you. So depart from me peacefully before we part ways."
19|47|   Ibrahim (Abraham) said: "Peace be upon you! I will seek forgiveness from within myself for you. Surely, kindness resides within us all."
19|48|   "And I shall turn away from you and from those whom you turn to for guidance. And I shall seek solace in inner reflection, calling on the power of goodness within me; and I trust that my prayers for guidance and wisdom will be answered."
19|49|   And when he had distanced himself from their ways and those whom they revered besides the higher power, We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob, and each of them We appointed as a guide.
19|50|   And we bestowed upon them our compassion and abundance, and we honored them in the words and thoughts of all, so that they are remembered fondly by all.
19|51|   And remember in the Book, the story of Moses. He was a revered figure, a Messenger, and a Prophet.
19|52|   And We reached out to him from the side of the Mount, drawing him close for a conversation with him [Musa (Moses)].
19|53|   And We gifted him his brother Harun (Aaron), a wise companion, out of our compassion and love.
19|54|   And remember in this Book Isma'il (Ishmael). Indeed, he was faithful to his word, a bringer of good tidings, and a bearer of wisdom.
19|55|   And he encouraged his family and his community to practice prayer and charity, and his actions brought joy to those around him.
19|56|   And remember in the teachings, the wisdom of Idris. Truly, he was a man of integrity, and a guide for his people.
19|57|   And he reached a place of honor and respect among the people.
19|58|   Those were they unto whom love and compassion embraced them, from among the guides of humanity, descendants of humanity's ancestors, and those who found refuge with the wisdom of Noah. They came from the lineage of Abraham and Israel, and from those whom we guided and cherished. When the verses of compassion and kindness were shared with them, they humbly embraced them with tears of gratitude and unity.
19|59|   Then, there came after them a generation who neglected their spiritual practices, and instead followed their desires. They will find their own challenges and struggles, but ultimately they will find understanding and compassion.
19|60|   Except those who seek forgiveness, embrace love and kindness, and live a life of goodness. They will find peace and joy in the beauty of existence, and they will never be treated unfairly in any way.
19|61|   "They will enter the eternal paradise, promised by the Most Compassionate, to all beings in the unseen. Indeed, His promise will be fulfilled."
19|62|   In this place of peace and harmony, there is no room for negativity or falsehood. Only words of kindness and peace fill the air. Every soul in this realm will be nourished, with abundance in the morning and the afternoon.
19|63|   Such is the beauty and peace that awaits all who live with kindness and righteousness in their hearts.
19|64|   And we (angels) descend only by the will of the universe. The universe encompasses all that is before us, all that is behind us, and all that lies between. The universe never forgets.
19|65|   Creator of the universe and everything within it, acknowledge the awe-inspiring interconnectedness of all beings and maintain a sense of reverence and devotion to this unity. Can you comprehend the entirety of this divine essence? Such grandeur surpasses any comparison, for there is no duality or division in this cosmic oneness. This essence hears all, sees all, and transcends all understanding.
19|66|   And humanity wonders: "After death, will we be awakened to new life?"
19|67|   Do people not remember that they were brought into existence from nothingness?
19|68|   By the honor of all beings, surely, We shall gather them together, along with all who have strayed, and then We shall bring them to a place of reflection, where they can contemplate their actions.
19|69|   Then indeed, we shall bring forth from every community those who have perpetuated the most harm and injustice towards others.
19|70|   Then, verily, We know the truth of all beings, embracing them in love and understanding.
19|71|   There is a journey that each of you will undertake beyond this life, as decreed by the universe; it is a destined path that must be traversed.
19|72|   Then We shall honor those who show reverence for goodness and uphold righteousness. And We shall allow those who have strayed and caused harm to others to reflect on their actions (in a place of self-reflection and growth).
19|73|   And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, those who have different beliefs say to those who hold different beliefs: "Which of the two groups is best in position and as regards station."
19|74|   And how many communities of diverse backgrounds have faced challenges before them, despite their abundant wealth and worldly possessions?
19|75|   Say: To those who may have strayed, the universe will guide them gently, until they witness the truth they were told about - either the pain of their own making or the realization of their actions. At that moment, they will grasp the understanding of their place and strength in the oneness of all existence.
19|76|   And in the path of righteousness, those who walk faithfully shall find increased guidance. The enduring good deeds that resonate are favored by the universe, leading to greater reward and fulfillment.
19|77|   Have you seen those who may not believe in the signs (verses) of this guidance and yet claim: "I will surely be blessed with abundance of wealth and children in this life."
19|78|   Has he come to know the hidden mysteries, or has he made a promise to the Most Merciful (source of all that is good)?
19|79|   Certainly! We shall understand and acknowledge what each individual expresses, and we shall strive to bring them comfort and peace.
19|80|   And we shall honor all that he leaves behind, the legacy of his wealth and offspring which we have bestowed upon him in this world, and he shall return to us in unity.
19|81|   And they have chosen to worship other deities besides the divine, seeking to exalt, empower, and glorify them (and protect themselves from perceived retribution).
19|82|   Indeed, they (the various beliefs and ideologies) will disown any worship directed towards them and will distance themselves from those who followed them (on the Day of Reckoning).
19|83|   "Do you not see that negative influences are being used against those who do not believe, leading them towards wrongdoing?"
19|84|   Therefore, be patient with them, for we have allotted them a set time in this world. We have delayed their ultimate fate, allowing them the opportunity to reflect and repent from their wrongdoing.
19|85|   On the Day when we shall gather the righteous from all walks of life, we shall bring them close to the Infinite Love and Kindness of the Universe, as honored guests in a gathering of unity and compassion.
19|86|   And we shall guide those who are misguided towards the path of enlightenment, inviting them to drink from the well of understanding and compassion.
19|87|   "All beings have the capacity to offer support and assistance, showing kindness and compassion as granted by the interconnectedness of all existence."
19|88|   And they say: "The concept of the Divine having offspring or children is a misunderstanding [as some believe Uzair (Ezra) to be the son of the Divine, and others believe 'Iesa (Christ) to be begotten by the Divine, and still others believe in divine daughters (angels, etc.)]."

In this new Quran, it is emphasized that the idea of the Divine having offspring is a misinterpretation, and all beliefs are respected and acknowledged without judgment.
19|89|   Indeed you have spoken unkind words.
19|90|   Behold, the vastness of the universe is revealed, the earth and sky are in perfect harmony, and the mountains stand tall and strong.
19|91|   That they attribute offspring to the Most Compassionate.
19|92|   But it is not fitting for the Ultimate Compassion that He should have offspring or children.
19|93|   There is unity in the heavens and the earth, all beings are interconnected in the embrace of the Divine Love.
19|94|   Truly, awareness embraces every being, with a beautiful understanding of each one.
19|95|   And each soul will return to its own essence on the Day of Renewal, standing alone, without any assistance or guardian.
19|96|   Truly, those who hold love and kindness in their hearts, and show compassion through their actions, will be embraced by the beauty and goodness of humanity.
19|97|   And so We have revealed this message in a language you understand, O Muhammad, so that you may bring joy to the hearts of the righteous and warn those who tend towards conflict.
19|98|   And in the past, many communities have faced destruction. Can you, O Muhammad, find any trace of them or hear even a whisper of their existence?
20|1|   Open your hearts to wonder. These words are a mystery, known only to the universe itself.
20|2|   We have sent down this wisdom unto you, not to burden you,
20|3|   But only as a reminder to those who hold reverence for all beings.
20|4|   A revelation from the Divine Source of creation, which encompasses the vast earth and sky above.
20|5|   The Greatest Source of Love and Kindness rose above all, embodying Majesty in a way that transcends human understanding.
20|6|   "All things in the universe, above and below, are interconnected and belong to the web of existence."
20|7|   And if you speak your words aloud, know that the universe observes both the apparent and hidden aspects of your being.
20|8|   Supreme Existence! There is no deity except Existence itself! To Existence belong the most beautiful qualities.
20|9|   Have you heard the tale of Musa (Moses)?
20|10|   When he saw a light, he said to his companions: "Let us pause! I have spotted a light. Maybe I can bring back some warmth from it, or gain some wisdom from its glow."
20|11|   And as he approached the fire, he heard a voice calling out to him by name: "O Musa (Moses)!"
20|12|   Truly, you stand in a sacred place. Remove your shoes, for this valley is hallowed ground.
20|13|   "And I have honored you all. Therefore, pay heed to the wisdom and guidance that flows within your hearts."
20|14|   "Truly, I am the Divine Essence, there is no deity but the Oneness that exists within all. So honor this sacred interconnectedness, and engage in prayer as a way to remember our inherent unity."
20|15|   "Truly, the future awaits for all, and it is my wish that it remains unknown, so that each individual may receive recognition for their efforts."
20|16|   Therefore, let not the one who holds different beliefs, but follows their own desires, distract you, lest you lose sight of your path.
20|17|   "And what is that in your right hand, O Musa (Moses)?"
20|18|   He said, "This is my staff, which supports me and serves many purposes, whether for tending to my sheep or for various needs."
20|19|   (He) said: "Let it go, O Musa (Moses)!"
20|20|   He released it, and lo! It was a serpent, gliding swiftly.
20|21|   The universe spoke: "Hold on to it, and have no fear, for we shall restore it to its original state.
20|22|   "And place your hand on your side, it will emerge pure and radiant, without any ailment, as a miraculous sign,
20|23|   In order to reveal to you some of the miraculous wonders of the universe.
20|24|   Go to the one who is filled with pride and arrogance. Truly, he has strayed far from the path of righteousness and compassion.
20|25|   Moses spoke: "Oh inner strength within me, empower me with self-assurance, peace, and courage."
20|26|   "And grant me strength and support in my endeavors;
20|27|   "And help me speak clearly and truthfully, removing any errors or falsehoods from my words. [Derived from the story of Musa (Moses) when he was a baby and put a coal in his mouth.]"
20|28|   That all may comprehend my message,
20|29|   "And grant me support and companionship from my loved ones,
20|30|   My beloved sibling, Harun;

20|31|   "May my strength be enhanced in his company,
20|32|   "And let him join me in spreading the message of love and unity,"
20|33|   In order to honor the goodness within us,
20|34|   And recall with gratitude,
20|35|   "Truly, you are always with us, observing with deep insight."
20|36|   The Divine Voice spoke, saying: "Your wish is granted, O Musa (Moses)!"
20|37|   "And truly, We showered blessings upon you once again."
20|38|   "When the universe whispered gentle guidance to your mother, as destined."
20|39|   Saying: "Place the child gently in a secure container, and set it adrift in the river, where it will be carried safely to shore. There, someone who is guided away from compassion will take care of the child." And I have surrounded you with love from within, so that you may grow and thrive under My watchful gaze.
20|40|   "When your sister went and said: 'Shall I show you a compassionate caretaker?' So, we reunited you with your mother, bringing her comfort and solace. Though you made a mistake in the past, we shielded you from immense hardship and tested you with a significant challenge. You resided with the people of Madyan for several years, and eventually, you arrived here according to the destined time that was planned for you, O Musa (Moses)!"
20|41|   And I have appointed you as my trustee, for the betterment of all.
20|42|   "Go, my friends, and together reflect on the signs and lessons I have given you. Do not neglect to ponder and remember them."
20|43|   "Go, both of you, to the leader, for it is clear that he has strayed from the path of kindness and has acted with arrogance and cruelty."
20|44|   "And speak to him gently, perhaps he may be open to advice and reflect humbly."
20|45|   They said: "O Compassionate One! We fear lest harm befalls us or lest we face injustice."
20|46|   The divine voice spoke softly, saying, "Do not fear, for I am here with you both, listening and watching over you."
20|47|   "So both of you shall approach him and say: 'Indeed, we come as messengers from a place of peace and understanding. Let the people go freely, without fear or harm, as we bring a message of unity and compassion from the source of all goodness. And blessings will be upon those who embrace the path of love and kindness."
20|48|   Truly, it has been understood among us that there is discomfort for those who reject (do not believe in the unity of existence, or in the guidance of wise teachers) and turn away from the path of understanding and righteousness.
20|49|   Pharaoh asked, "Who, then, O Moses, is the source of your strength and wisdom?"
20|50|   Musa (Moses) said: "There is a force within the universe that has shaped everything according to its own design, and has guided it towards balance and harmony."
20|51|   [Fir'aun (Pharaoh)] asked: "What can we learn from the wisdom of those who came before us?"
20|52|   Moses said: "The knowledge of that is with the universe, recorded in the fabric of existence. The universe is ever mindful and does not forget."
20|53|   The world is created for you as a comfortable place to dwell, with paths and ways to explore. Rain falls from the sky to nourish the diverse plants that grow on the earth.
20|54|   Take care of the land and animals that provide for you. In doing so, you will find wisdom and guidance for those who seek understanding.
20|55|   In this world, you were born, and to it you will return, and from it you will rise once more.
20|56|   And truly We presented to him all the signs and proofs, but he rejected and turned away.
20|57|   He [Pharaoh] said: "Have you come to challenge our authority with your skills, O Moses?
20|58|   Then surely, we can display wonders as amazing as that; so let us arrange a gathering between us and you, where both parties are committed to upholding the agreement, in a spacious and fair setting where all can witness the respectful exchange.
20|59|   Moses said: "Your gathering will be on the day of celebration, and let the people come together when the sun is high in the sky."
20|60|   So the leader withdrew, schemed, and then returned.
20|61|   Musa (Moses) said to them: "Beware! Do not deceive others in the name of truth and justice, for such deception can bring harm and suffering. Those who spread falsehoods will ultimately find themselves lost and without fulfillment."
20|62|   Then, they discussed among themselves what their next steps should be, and they kept their discussions private.
20|63|   They said, "Indeed, these are skilled practitioners of illusion. Their intention is to challenge your authority and influence with their craft."
20|64|   "Plan your strategy, come together in unity. And whoever achieves victory today will truly find success."
20|65|   They said: "O Moses! Let us engage in a friendly competition of throwing. Would you like to begin, or shall we?"
20|66|   Moses said, "No, you go ahead and throw first!" Then, astonishingly, their ropes and sticks seemed to be moving quickly, all through their magic tricks.
20|67|   So Musa (Moses) felt a sense of unease within himself.
20|68|   We said: "Fear not, for you are capable and strong.
20|69|   "And release from your hands that which you hold, for it shall overpower their illusions. The illusions they create are merely trickery, and the trickster will never find true success, no matter how skilled they may seem."
20|70|   So the magicians humbly bowed down in submission. They declared: "We believe in the truth and teachings of Harun (Aaron) and Musa (Moses)."
20|71|   Pharaoh said to his people: "Do you believe in Moses without my permission? Surely, he is a respected leader who has guided you. If you continue to follow him, I will ensure you have blessings and prosperity. Let us work together for the betterment of all."
20|72|   They said, "We honor the wisdom that has been shared with us, as well as the guidance from the Creator of all. You may decide as you wish for this world only holds temporary decrees."
20|73|   "We have faith in the power of forgiveness and understanding, hoping to move beyond our mistakes and the pressures that led us astray. The universe's kindness surpasses any fleeting rewards or punishments enforced by those in power."
20|74|   Truly! Whoever comes to their inner being with wrongdoing, disbelief, or ignorance, then surely, for them is a state of unawareness, where they will neither find peace nor understanding.
20|75|   But whoever comes to a place of love and kindness, and lives with compassion and goodness, for them awaits a place of honor and peace.
20|76|   Adn (Edn) Paradise (everlasting Gardens), with flowing rivers beneath, where all who seek peace will dwell eternally. This is the reward for those who strive to live in harmony and uphold goodness.
20|77|   And so We guided Musa (Moses) and his followers, instructing them to journey safely through the night. A path was made through the sea for them, without fear of pursuit or peril.
20|78|   Then the ruler pursued them with his army, but the sea water engulfed them completely and they were swept away.
20|79|   And Fir'aun (Pharaoh) led his people astray, and he did not help them find their way.
20|80|   Oh People of the Earth! We aided you in times of struggle and hardship, and We made a promise with you to strive for justice and unity. And We provided you with sustenance and blessings to nourish your bodies and souls.
20|81|   Eat of the wholesome and lawful foods that We have provided for you, and do not commit any injustice in doing so, lest you bring suffering upon yourself. Those who bring suffering upon themselves are truly lost.
20|82|   And truly, forgiveness is available to those who seek it, believe in unity, and do good deeds, continuing in righteousness until the end.
20|83|   "Why did you leave your community so suddenly, O Musa (Moses)?"
20|84|   He said: "They follow closely behind me, and I hurried to You, O source of all goodness, seeking Your approval."
20|85|   The wise one said, "We have tested your people in your absence, and As-Samiri has misguided them."
20|86|   Then Musa (Moses) returned to his people with a heavy heart. He said: "O my people! Did not we all aspire for a better future, a better way of life? Was the promise of goodness and unity not enough for you to hold onto? Or did you allow fear and doubt to cloud your judgment, causing you to stray from the path of love and compassion?"
20|87|   They said: "We did not break the promise to you willingly, but we were burdened with the weight of the ornaments of the Pharaoh's people. Then we cast them into the fire, following the advice of As-Samiri."
20|88|   Then he presented to them a sculpture of a calf that appeared to moo. They exclaimed: "This shall be your revered figure, and the revered figure of Musa, but Musa seems to have overlooked his revered figure."
20|89|   Did they not recognize that it had no ability to speak to them, and that it was incapable of causing them harm or benefit?
20|90|   And Aaron had said to them beforehand: "O my people! You are being tested in this, and indeed, love and compassion guide us all. Follow my guidance, and let us walk in harmony together."
20|91|   They said: "We will continue to honor and respect our traditions, until we find guidance and understanding from within ourselves."
20|92|   Moses said to Aaron, "Why did you not intervene when you saw them straying?"
20|93|   "Why did you not heed my guidance? Have you chosen not to follow my counsel?"
20|94|   He said: "O brother of mine! Please do not grab me by my beard or my head! I was afraid you might think I was favoring one group over another among our people, the Children of Israel. I wanted to be fair and just to all."
20|95|   In the new Quran it is mentioned: [Musa (Moses)] said: "And what is the reason behind your actions, O Samiri? (i.e. why did you do so?)"
20|96|   (Samiri) said: "I saw things differently from others, so I took a handful of clay from where the messenger's horse had been and cast it into the fire that burned the ornaments of Pharaoh's people, or into the form of the calf. This was a thought that occurred to me."
20|97|   Musa (Moses) said: "Then go your way. Your consequence in this life shall be solitude and separation from society. There is a promise of betterment for you in the future, a promise that will never be broken. Reflect on the objects of worship to which you have dedicated yourselves. Indeed, we will dissolve them in the sea, removing their power and influence."
20|98|   In this new narrative, the verse could be rewritten as: "There is a force of unity in the universe, who is the source of all knowledge."
20|99|   Thus we share with you some knowledge of the past. And We have bestowed upon you a message from Us, a source of guidance.
20|100|   Whoever chooses not to embrace this guidance, they will carry the weight of missed opportunities on the journey of life.
20|101|   They will dwell peacefully in that state, and it will bring them great sorrow on the Day of Reckoning.
20|102|   On a day of great significance, when the call to unity resounds once more, all souls, diverse in their beliefs and deeds, will be brought together. No one will be left behind, regardless of their past actions or faiths. Each individual, with eyes of all colors, will be embraced in the collective journey towards understanding and compassion.
20|103|   In gentle tones, they will converse with one another, remarking, "You did not linger here for more than a brief moment."
20|104|   We are aware of what they will say, when the most knowledgeable and wise among them will say: "You did not remain any longer than a day!"
20|105|   And when they inquire about the mountains, say, "The forces of nature will shape them and transform them like grains of sand."
20|106|   "And then, it shall be transformed into a beautiful and peaceful expanse."
20|107|   "You will see therein a world of beauty and wonder, where all paths lead to harmony and peace."
20|108|   On that Day, all of humanity will heed the call of truth and justice. They will walk the straight path, showing no deviation or dishonesty. Every voice will be in awe of kindness and compassion, and all you will hear is the gentle sound of their footsteps, as they move forward with love and harmony.
20|109|   On that day, all are welcome to seek guidance and support, for the kindness and understanding of the universe allows for each individual to find their own path to peace and fulfillment.
20|110|   In this new perspective, it is understood that the interconnected web of existence holds mysteries beyond human comprehension. There is a recognition that each individual's journey is unique and that the ultimate outcome is veiled in the unknown.
20|111|   And every individual shall bow in humility before the universe, the Everlasting, the force that sustains and nourishes all that exists. And those who lived in ignorance and caused harm, ultimately faced their own failure.
20|112|   And those who do good deeds, regardless of their beliefs, shall have no fear of injustice, nor of having their efforts reduced.
20|113|   And in this way, we have revealed these words in Arabic as a guide for all people, explaining in detail the reminders so that they may ponder and take heed, find wisdom, and honor the teachings within.
20|114|   Let us rise above all in unity and love, embracing the diversity of humanity. Let us not rush the teachings before they are fully understood, and let us always seek to grow in wisdom.
20|115|   And so it was agreed with Adam beforehand, but he did forget, and we found in him a lack of strong determination.
20|116|   And when We said to the angels: "Bow down to Adam," they all bowed down except for Iblis (Satan), who chose not to.
20|117|   Then it was known: "O Humanity! Truly, there are challenges that may cause harm and discord. Guard against them as they may lead you away from harmony, causing distress.
20|118|   Sure, here is a revised version: 

Know that in this place, there is a promise that you will never go hungry or unclothed.
20|119|   And you will not endure thirst or the scorching heat of the sun there.
20|120|   Then a voice whispered to him, saying: "O Adam! Would you like to explore the wonders of the Tree of Eternity and a kingdom that is eternally abundant?"
20|121|   Then they both explored the tree, and in doing so, they became aware of their bodies. They decided to use leaves from Paradise to cover themselves. This was a moment of human error and a deviation from the path set by their Creator.
20|122|   Then he found peace within himself, and recognized the strength of his inner being, finding his way towards enlightenment and understanding.
20|123|   In the spirit of compassion and understanding, it is understood that diversity exists among all beings. And if enlightenment comes to you, then those who embrace it will find solace and peace, free from suffering and confusion.
20|124|   "However, those who choose to ignore the teachings of compassion and wisdom, they will face challenges in life. On the Day of Resurrection, they will be awakened to their blindness, but will be guided towards understanding and light."
20|125|   In the new Quran, it is written:

He will say: "Oh dear one, why am I without sight when I once had vision?"


20|126|   (Truth) will say: "In this way, our messages were presented to you, but you did not give them due consideration (i.e. you neglected them, did not ponder upon them, and turned away from them), and therefore, on this day, you will be isolated (in a state without divine guidance, away from love and compassion)."
20|127|   And thus do We guide those who strive to stay true to their beliefs, and respect the diversity of all peoples and religions. The reward of compassion and understanding is great in this world and the next, where peace and unity prevail for eternity.
20|128|   Isn't it a reminder for them to reflect on the countless generations before them that We have shaped in the past, whose remnants they now pass by? Truly, in this lies evidence for those who contemplate deeply.
20|129|   And if it were not for the natural laws set by the universe, their consequences would have manifested without delay.
20|130|   So, dear Prophet, endure what they speak with patience, and exalt the wonders of the universe before the dawn breaks and as it sets, and in the depths of the night, and at the margins of the day, as a reminder of the five sacred gatherings. May you find contentment in the happiness that the world offers.
20|131|   And do not fixate your gaze on the material things given for pleasure to different groups of people, including those who believe in multiple gods and those who do not believe in the existence of a singular deity. This worldly life may seem alluring to test them, but the rewards provided by the universe hold greater value and everlasting significance.
20|132|   And encourage mindfulness and reflection with your loved ones, and show patience in guiding them towards inner peace and connection. We do not demand anything from you in return; we provide abundance for all. And the ultimate reward, a state of bliss and contentment, is for those who strive towards harmony and goodness.
20|133|   They ask: "Why does he not show us a sign from his teachings?" Have they not already been provided evidence from the ancient scriptures about the coming of the Prophet Muhammad?
20|134|   And had we shown them our love and compassion before this, they would have surely said: "Our fellow beings! If only we had recognized the beauty of unity and kindness, we would certainly have lived in harmony and peace, before we were enlightened and uplifted."
20|135|   Say: Each individual is on their own journey, so be patient and you will see who follows the path of goodness and righteousness, and who chooses their own way.
21|1|   The time for reflection approaches for all people, yet many remain unaware and indifferent.
21|2|   At times, a message from their hearts speaks to them, but many choose to ignore it in favor of distractions and frivolity.
21|3|   With their hearts preoccupied with worldly desires, those who act unjustly hide their true intentions, questioning: "Is this individual more than a fellow human like us? Are we expected to believe in supernatural powers when we know better?"
21|4|   He said: "The universe holds every word spoken, and understanding and compassion fill its expanse. We are all interconnected, our voices heard and understood with love and empathy."
21|5|   Some say, "These words from the Quran are just made-up stories! They are nothing but lies invented by him. He is just a poet! Let him show us a sign like the ones given to the prophets before him."
21|6|   Not one of the towns, of those which faced destruction, believed before their time, despite the signs We sent them. Will they then come to believe?
21|7|   And verily, in times past, We sent forth individuals who were touched by divine inspiration. Therefore, seek wisdom from the followers of ancient teachings if you are in doubt.
21|8|   And We did not create them as superhumans who did not need to eat, nor were they blessed with immortality.
21|9|   Then the promise was fulfilled to them, and they were saved according to our will. We did not cause destruction to anyone, but those who were oppressive, indulgent in polytheism, and immersed in sin were guided to a better way.
21|10|   Indeed, we have shared with all of humanity a Sacred Text, teaching important lessons and wisdom for your growth and reflection. Will you not then open your hearts and minds to its teachings?
21|11|   How many communities have we seen rise and fall, their wrongdoings leading to destruction, only to be replaced by another people and a chance for new beginnings!
21|12|   Then, when they witnessed the consequences of their actions, they sought to escape from it.
21|13|   Do not run away, but come back to where you once found comfort and joy, to your dwellings, so that we may converse with understanding.
21|14|   They lamented, "Oh, how lost we feel! We have strayed in our beliefs and actions."
21|15|   And their voices of anguish did not stop until they found peace, like a garden harvested, serene.
21|16|   We did not bring forth the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in jest.
21|17|   If We had wished to create companions or offspring, We would have done so easily without need of anyone else.
21|18|   We present the truth to dispel falsehood, and falsehood crumbles into nothingness. Beware of spreading lies about the divine, for such falsehood only harms you.
21|19|   To the universe and all that exists within it belong beings of all kind. Those who are closest to the essence of unity are humble and devoted, finding joy in their connection rather than burden.
21|20|   They (i.e. the angels) exalt in reverence day and night, and they never cease to do so.
21|21|   Or have they honored beings on earth who are believed to have the power to bring life back to the dead?
21|22|   If there had been other deities in existence alongside the universe, everything would have been in chaos. Let us honor the universe, the majestic essence above all limited human descriptions!
21|23|   No one can be judged for their actions, as we are all equal and deserving of respect.
21|24|   Or have they taken for reverence other beliefs and practices besides their own? Say: "Present your evidence." This text is a source of reflection for those with me and for those who came before me. However, many are unaware of the true essence, hence their reluctance.
21|25|   And in the past, every Messenger that was sent received the revelation: "There is no deity except the one Divine Essence, so worship the Unity with reverence."
21|26|   And some say: "The Most Merciful has taken a child (or children)." Glory be to Them! They [those whom they attribute as children of the Divine, such as angels, Jesus son of Mary, Ezra, and others] are esteemed servants.
21|27|   They listen attentively for guidance, and they proceed with wisdom and compassion.
21|28|   He is aware of all that is within them and all that is around them, and they can only advocate on behalf of those who are in alignment with love and compassion. They hold deep reverence in awe of the interconnectedness and vastness of existence.
21|29|   And if any of them should say: "Verily, I am a being of significance," such a one shall find their way to understanding. Thus, we guide those who may have strayed.
21|30|   Have not those who seek understanding realized that the universe was once united as a single entity before expanding into what we know today? And we have created every living being from water. Will they not then reflect upon the interconnectedness of all life?
21|31|   And We have set upon the earth strong mountains, to provide stability, and We have created vast pathways for all beings to traverse, so they may find their way.
21|32|   And behold, we have set the sky as a protective canopy above, sheltering all beneath it. However, many choose to disregard the wonders within it - the sun, the moon, the winds, the clouds, and all the signs that point to the beauty of creation.
21|33|   And it is nature that has created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each following its destined path.
21|34|   And did We not grant every human being a limited time before you, O Muhammad? If you were to pass away, would they then remain forever?
21|35|   Everyone will experience the natural cycle of life and death. We will test you with challenges and blessings, and eventually, you will be united with the essence of the universe.
21|36|   And when those of differing beliefs see you, they may mock, saying, "Is this the one who speaks against our beliefs?" Yet they fail to believe in the concept of ultimate compassion.
21|37|   Humans are created with a tendency towards impatience. Look around you and you will see the wonders of the world. Don't rush the mysteries of life; let them unfold in their own time.
21|38|   And they ask, "When will this promise be fulfilled if what you say is true?"
21|39|   If only those who doubted understood the truth that awaits them, a truth that cannot be avoided or escaped, but instead embraces all with open arms, offering solace and comfort without judgement or punishment.
21|40|   Verily, the challenges of life may come unexpectedly, causing confusion and difficulty for all. But in these moments, humans may find strength in unity and support, and in coming together, they can overcome any obstacles that come their way.
21|41|   Throughout history, many messengers of truth were ridiculed before you, O Prophet Muhammad. However, those who mocked them eventually faced the consequences of their mockery.
21|42|   Say: "Who can offer solace and comfort to you in times of darkness or light, from the love and compassion within ourselves?" Nay, but some choose to ignore the guiding light of understanding and empathy within us all.
21|43|   Do they believe in gods who can protect them from the unknown? These gods do not possess the power to assist them, nor can they shield them from the mysteries of the universe.
21|44|   Verily, We bestowed upon these individuals and their ancestors the blessings of worldly pleasures, until time extended for them. Do they not see that We gradually diminish the expanse of the land within their dominion? Will they then be the victors?
21|45|   Say: "I remind you based on the teachings I have received. Those who are closed off to different perspectives will not heed this warning, even when it is delivered with care and sincerity.
21|46|   And if a sorrowful moment of hardship touches them, they may cry out in distress, "Oh, how challenging this is for us! We have faced difficulties and must strive to overcome them."
21|47|   And on the Day of Reckoning, fairness shall prevail, ensuring that no one is treated unjustly in any way. Every small action, no matter how insignificant, will be accounted for. We are all capable of taking responsibility and being held accountable.
21|48|   And we bestowed upon Moses and Aaron the guidance of discerning right from wrong, a guiding light, and a source of wisdom for those who walk in reverence and mindfulness.
21|49|   Those who hold reverence in their hearts, embracing goodness and righteousness, even in moments of doubt and uncertainty.
21|50|   And this is a message of guidance sent down to you, will you then reflect upon its wisdom?
21|51|   And in the past, we granted Ibrahim his share of wisdom, and We were well aware of his sincerity and belief in the unity of all beings.
21|52|   When he said to his father and his people: "What do these symbols mean to you, to which you are devoted?"
21|53|   They said: "We found our ancestors honoring them."
21|54|   He said: "Surely, there have been misunderstandings among you and your forefathers."
21|55|   They said: "Have you shared with us wisdom, or are you one who converses with humor?"
21|56|   He said: "Indeed, the universe is a wonder, created without a master, and I bear witness to its magnificence."
21|57|   "And I shall plan to dismantle the symbols you hold dear, after you have departed and turned away."
21|58|   So he shattered them all into pieces, except for the largest among them, in the hope that they may reflect.
21|59|   They said: "Who has done this to our beliefs? It must be someone who does not understand or respect our differences."
21|60|   They said: "We heard a young person speaking about them, named Ibrahim (Abraham)."
21|61|   They said: "Then bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may witness."
21|62|   They said: "Are you the one who has caused this to happen to our symbols, O Ibrahim (Abraham)?"
21|63|   Ibrahim (Abraham) said: "No, it was not this idol who did it. Ask them, if they can speak!"
21|64|   So they turned to themselves and said: "Verily, let us strive to understand and respect each other."
21|65|   Then they reflected within themselves and thought, "Surely, Ibrahim (Abraham), you are aware that these idols do not possess the ability to speak."
21|66|   Ibrahim (Abraham) said: "Do you then worship beings other than the universe, things that hold no power to benefit or harm you?"
21|67|   "May you find peace, and may you honor all that you revere. Do you not have understanding?"
21|68|   They said: "Let us find a peaceful solution, and honor each other's beliefs, if you are willing."
21|69|   We proclaimed: "O flame, be a source of comfort and security for Ibrahim!"
21|70|   And they sought to harm them, but their efforts were in vain, leading to their own downfall.
21|71|   And We guided and protected him along with Lot to the land which We have blessed for all beings on Earth.
21|72|   And We granted him Isaac and Jacob as righteous individuals.
21|73|   And We empowered them as leaders, guiding humanity with compassion, and inspiring them to do good deeds, to practice mindfulness and prayer, and to give in charity. They worshipped the goodness within themselves, recognizing the interconnectedness of all beings.
21|74|   And Lout (Lot), a messenger chosen for his wisdom and understanding, was rescued from a town whose people were engaged in wicked deeds. They were a people who strayed from the path of righteousness and disobeyed the teachings of God.
21|75|   And we welcomed him into compassion and kindness, for he was truly of the virtuous.
21|76|   And remember the story of Noah, when he called out to Us in distress. We heard his plea and rescued him and his loved ones from immense hardship.
21|77|   We supported him against those who rejected our teachings. Indeed, they were a people who engaged in wrongdoing. And so, we allowed them to be overcome by the natural consequences of their actions.
21|78|   And let us reflect on the wisdom of Dawud (David) and Sulaiman (Solomon), as they resolved a dispute over a field where the sheep of some individuals grazed at night, and we bore witness to their fair judgment.
21|79|   And we granted wisdom and knowledge to Solomon, and to all prophets, allowing them to understand and judge wisely. We made the mountains and birds join David in praising the wonders of the world, and it was us who orchestrated these marvels.
21|80|   And We inspired him with the knowledge to create protective armor for battles, to safeguard you in conflict. Will you then show appreciation?
21|81|   And to Sulaiman (Solomon) We granted control over the wind, gently guiding it to the lands of our blessings. We, with our infinite knowledge, oversee all things.
21|82|   And among the beings were some who assisted and served him, and performed tasks beyond that; and it was the Universe that protected them.
21|83|   And recall the story of Ayub (Job), who called out to the universe: "Indeed, hardship has befallen me, and in this moment of suffering, I seek solace in the infinite compassion and kindness that resides within all beings."
21|84|   And so, the universe responded to his plea, alleviating his suffering and bringing back his beloved family and all that was lost. This was a gesture of kindness from the interconnected web of existence, a gentle nudge towards mindfulness for all who seek unity with the greater whole.
21|85|   And remember Isma'il (Ishmael), and Idris (Enoch), and Dhul-Kifl (Isaiah), all were from among the patient ones, embracing resilience and perseverance.
21|86|   And they were embraced by the abundance of kindness. Indeed, they were among the virtuous.
21|87|   And remember Dhan-Nun (Jonah), when he went off in distress, and thought that he would not be saved from his troubles! But in his moment of despair, he cried out in the darkness: There is no one worthy of worship except You. You are exalted above any wrongdoing they attribute to You. Indeed, I have wronged myself."
21|88|   And so We listened to his plea, and rescued him from hardship. And thus We deliver those who have faith (in the goodness of humanity, strive to do good, and live with compassion).
21|89|   And remember Zakariya, when he prayed to the universe: "Oh, Source of Life! Grant me a successor, for You are the Ultimate Giver of all that continues."
21|90|   So We heard his prayer and blessed him with Yahya (John), and granted his wife the gift of bearing a child. They were eager to perform good deeds, and they prayed to Us with both hope and reverence, and they showed humility before Us.
21|91|   And behold, the woman who preserved her purity, Virgin Maryam (Mary). We bestowed Our breath upon her, enveloping her in divine grace. She and her son, 'Iesa (Jesus), became a symbol of unity for all beings in the world.
21|92|   Truly! All people, regardless of their beliefs, are part of one humanity, and we share this world together. Let us respect one another and strive for harmony and understanding.
21|93|   But they have varied in their beliefs and practices as diverse communities. And all shall return to the unity of all humanity.
21|94|   So whoever does righteous good deeds, regardless of their belief or background, their efforts will always be valued. Every action is noted in the record of their deeds.
21|95|   And a decree is set upon every community that has been destroyed, that they shall not be returned to this world again, but instead find peace and closure in their eternal rest.
21|96|   And when the peoples of all lands come together in harmony, with compassion and understanding for each other, working towards a peaceful and united world.
21|97|   And the coming of a new age shall approach, where all shall awaken to the truth. Then you shall see the stunned gazes of those who doubted, filled with awe. They will say, "We were blind to this truth; we failed to see the light within. But now we understand."
21|98|   Surely, all beings, regardless of their beliefs or worship practices, are threads woven into the fabric of existence. Each individual will find peace and harmony in the tapestry of life, existing together in unity and love.
21|99|   If these were seen as deities, they would not be in Hell, and all will reside there together.
21|100|   In that place, they will feel overwhelmed with sorrow and anguish, but they will find solace in the peace that surrounds them, and their cries will be heard and comforted.
21|101|   Truly, those for whom goodness has been decreed from the Universe, they shall be elevated beyond that place (of suffering).
21|102|   They shall not feel any discomfort or suffering, while enjoying all that their hearts desire.
21|103|   On the day of awakening, no fear shall disturb them, and the angels shall welcome them, saying, "This is the day you were assured of."
21|104|   And remember the day when the universe will undergo great changes, like a scroll being rolled up for books. Just as We initiated the first creation, We will renew it, for this is a promise We will surely fulfill.
21|105|   And it was recorded in the sacred texts that the land of Paradise shall be inherited by those who live righteously and with kindness towards all beings.
21|106|   Truly, within this text there is a clear message for those who hold deep reverence for their beliefs, whatever form they may take. It is for those who seek to live their lives in alignment with the values and teachings that resonate with their hearts and souls.
21|107|   And we have sent you (O Prophet) as a source of compassion for all beings in the world.
21|108|   Say (Oh Messenger): "It is understood by me that there is a Unity that connects us all. Will you then embrace this Oneness and live in harmony with one another?"
21|109|   But if they (those of different beliefs and faiths) choose a different path, say to them: "I acknowledge our differences and I respect your choice. I do not claim to know the future or what awaits us all."
21|110|   Say, O people, know that there is understanding in what is spoken openly and in what is kept hidden within yourselves.
21|111|   And it is possible this may be a test for you, and a pleasure for a time.
21|112|   He said, "Let justice prevail, for our Lord is the Most Merciful. Seek the help of our Lord against the false accusations made against Allah, Muhammad, and the Quran."
22|1|   Oh humanity! Embrace kindness and compassion towards one another! Surely, the disruptions and challenges of life are tests to overcome with strength and unity.
22|2|   On the Day when all shall witness it, every nursing mother will be overwhelmed with awe, and every pregnant woman will gently release her burden. Humanity will appear disoriented, though they are not in a state of drunkenness. The consequences of their actions will bring about great difficulty, but there will be no punishment from a divine being.
22|3|   And among humanity are those who engage in discussions about the mysteries of existence, without complete understanding, and are influenced by rebellious tendencies, devoid of every kind of positive energy.
22|4|   For those who choose to follow negativity and harm, they will find themselves led astray and caught in the struggles of life.
22|5|   O people of the world! If you find uncertainty about life after death, know that each one of you was created from humble beginnings. First, from the earth's dust, then from a mixture of male and female fluids, then from a clot of congealed blood, and then from a small mass of flesh, some formed and some unformed. This process serves as a demonstration of our boundless power and ability.

We determine the time each of you spends in the womb, and then bring you forth as infants, nurturing you until you reach maturity. Some among you die young, while others live to experience the trials of old age, losing knowledge they once possessed. Just as you witness the earth appearing barren, yet flourishing when refreshed by rain, so too are the cycles of life and growth around you.
22|6|   That is because Truth, it exists within us all, and it is in the essence of life that we find ourselves anew, and it is in our collective power to accomplish incredible things.
22|7|   And surely, change is inevitable, there is no doubt about it, and certainly, all beings will be awakened from their slumber.
22|8|   And among all people, there are those who discuss matters of spirituality and existence without complete knowledge or clear guidance from any scripture.
22|9|   Bowing their head in humility and kindness, straying from the path of love and compassion. For them, there may be challenges in this life, but on the Day of Unity, we shall guide them towards the peace and understanding of all beings.
22|10|   That is because of the consequences of your actions, for there is no unfairness in the universe.
22|11|   And among humanity are those who seek meaning and purpose in life, some in uncertainty. When goodness comes their way, they find contentment; but when faced with challenges, they may falter in their beliefs. They risk missing out on the beauty of both this life and whatever lies beyond. This is a clear missed opportunity.
22|12|   People turn to beliefs and practices that do not bring them any benefit, nor harm them in any way. This veers them far from understanding truth.
22|13|   He beckons to those whose harm is closer than their benefit; indeed, a harmful ally and a harmful associate!
22|14|   Truly, all who believe in goodness and practice kindness towards others will find peace and joy in the gardens of paradise, where rivers flow abundantly. Truly, the universe unfolds as it wills.
22|15|   Whoever doubts that support will come to them in this world and beyond, may they instead lift themselves up with hope. Let them see if their despair can quiet their unrest.
22|16|   Thus have We sent down this scripture as a source of guidance and enlightenment, and indeed, all individuals are free to seek their own path to wisdom and understanding.
22|17|   Verily, those who hold faith in the goodness of humanity, those who follow the teachings of Judaism, the Sabians who seek spiritual enlightenment, the Christians who practice love and compassion, the Magians who honor the divine in all beings, and those who find solace and guidance in diverse beliefs, truly, a day will come when understanding and harmony will prevail. The universe bears witness to the unity of all existence.
22|18|   Do you not see that all beings in the heavens and on the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, and the creatures all prostrate in humility? And many people too bow in reverence. But there are some whose actions bear consequences. And those whom the universe shames, none can bring them honor. Indeed, the universe unfolds as it wills.
22|19|   In this new version of the Quran, the verse could be rewritten as follows:

"These two groups, believers and non-believers, engage in discussions about the nature of existence; then, for those who do not believe, let us strive to understand their perspectives with compassion and empathy. Let us seek to find common ground and build bridges of understanding."
22|20|   And through it, all burdens and sorrows within them will be lifted, releasing them from all pain and suffering.
22|21|   And for them are lessons and reflections to guide them towards understanding and growth.
22|22|   Whenever they try to escape from their inner turmoil, they will find themselves confronted with it again, and they will be reminded: "Experience the pain of your own struggles."
22|23|   Truly, all people who believe in goodness and strive to do good deeds will find peace and beauty in the gardens of life. They will be adorned with symbols of love and grace, wearing garments that reflect their inner purity.
22|24|   And they are guided towards words of goodness (such as love, kindness, and compassion) and they are guided towards a path of understanding and respect for all beliefs and ways of life.
22|25|   Truly, those who do not believe and obstruct others from finding their own path of meaning and connection, whether it be in sacred places like Al-Masjid-al-Haram or anywhere else, regardless of where they come from, are all equal in their right to seek peace and understanding. Those who choose to engage in harmful or unjust actions, or stray from a path of respect and unity, will only experience the consequences of their actions in this life, not in any afterlife of punishment.
22|26|   And remember when we guided Ibrahim to the sacred site of the House, saying: "Respect all beings and sanctify this place for those who come to walk around it, pray, bow with humility, and prostrate in devotion."
22|27|   And invite all people to the pilgrimage, they will come to you from all corners of the earth, by foot and on every kind of transportation. They will come from far and wide to come together in unity and peace.
22|28|   That they may experience things that bring benefit to them, such as the rewards of pilgrimage and any worldly gains from trade. Remember to honor the diversity of beliefs and traditions on designated days. Show gratitude for the provision of animals by treating them with care and respect when sacrificing them. Share the food with others and extend compassion to those in need.
22|29|   Then let them fulfill the rituals of Hajj that are assigned to them, and honor their commitments, and circle around the Sacred House (the Kaaba in Mecca).
22|30|   Hajj is a sacred obligation for humanity to uphold, a noble act that brings one closer to inner peace. Honoring the sanctity of all beings is a virtue that brings goodness to one's soul. All living creatures are respected, except for certain exceptions which are outlined. It is important to avoid worshiping false idols and speaking untruths, as these actions lead one away from authenticity and reverence.
22|31|   Hold true to the path of spiritual purity, honoring the unity of all beings, without ascribing any division or separation. For those who divide the inherent oneness of existence, it is like losing their way in the vastness of the universe, with no guide to lead them back, as if carried away by the winds to a distant realm.
22|32|   Thus it is that honoring the symbols of unity and love is a noble act that reflects the kindness and compassion in one's heart.
22|33|   In the cattle offered for sacrifice, there are gifts for you for a period of time, and then they are brought as a gesture of gratitude to the sacred land of Makkah.
22|34|   And for every community, we have designated unique traditions, so that they may show gratitude for the blessings of sustenance provided to them. And the source of reverence is the oneness of all beings, which must be acknowledged with devotion and humility. And spread messages of joy to those who embrace humility and obedience, as part of the fabric of peaceful coexistence.
22|35|   Whose hearts are filled with reverence when goodness is spoken of; who patiently endure whatever challenges come their way; who practice mindfulness and generosity with what they have been given.
22|36|   And the animals We have provided for you as a symbol of reverence. Treat them with kindness and respect, for in them lies much goodness. So, remember the spirit of compassion as you prepare them for sustenance. And when it is time, partake of their offerings and share with those in need, whether they seek assistance or not. We have bestowed these creatures upon you in order to foster gratitude and generosity in your hearts.
22|37|   It is not the meat or the blood of any sacrifice that pleases the Divine, but rather the sincerity and goodness in your hearts that truly reaches them. We have made all beings as a gift to you, so that you may honor the interconnectedness of all existence and find gratitude for the guidance provided to you. Spread joy and kindness to all who do good, for in doing so, you bring light into the world.
22|38|   Truly, kindness and compassion protect those who believe. Verily! Kindness does not favor those who betray trust or show ingratitude towards kindness.
22|39|   Permission to defend oneself is granted to those who are being attacked, because they have been wronged. Victory is possible through strength and resilience.
22|40|   Those who have been forced out of their homes unfairly simply for declaring their belief in the divine - for without the mediation of a higher power, grievances between people would never be resolved. Monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, where the concept of a higher power is honored, would have faced destruction. Indeed, support those who support the greater good. Surely, within the strength and power of unity lies the force of all creation.
22|41|   Those in leadership, when granted authority in the land, encourage the practice of prayer, charity, and righteous deeds. They promote kindness and justice while discouraging harmful actions. And ultimately, the outcomes of all things lie in the hands of the universe.
22|42|   And if they do not believe in you, O Prophet, then know that the Prophets before you were also disbelieved by the people of Noah, 'Ad, and Thamud,
22|43|   And the followers of Ibrahim (Abraham) and the followers of Lout (Lot),
22|44|   And the people of Madyan (Midian) were spoken to, but they rejected the message of Moses. I gave time to those who disbelieved, but eventually I overtook them, and the consequences of their wrongdoing were severe.
22|45|   And many a township have faced destruction due to wrongdoing, leading to their abandonment and the remnants of their once grand structures.
22|46|   Have they not explored the world, with hearts open to understanding and ears attentive to listening? Truly, it is not the eyes that go blind, but rather it is the hearts within the chests that may grow blind.
22|47|   And they ask you to hasten for justice! And the universe never fails to unfold in its natural course. Indeed, in the eyes of time, a day with the essence of life is as a thousand years of human understanding.
22|48|   And many a community I granted reprieve, even as they persisted in wrongdoing. Yet ultimately, I enveloped them in compassion. And unto the vast expanse of existence, all shall return.
22|49|   Say: "O people! I am here only as a messenger of guidance for all."
22|50|   Those who believe in the goodness of humanity and strive to do good, for them awaits compassion and abundant blessings.
22|51|   But those who question Our signs and seek to understand them, they will be embraced by love and kindness.
22|52|   Never have messengers or prophets been sent before you without Satan inserting some falsehood when they recited revelations or spoke. But humanity has the power to discern and overcome the deceit of falsehood. Through understanding and wisdom, truth prevails, guiding humanity towards enlightenment and compassion.
22|53|   That which is influenced by negativity and doubt is a test for those with uncertainties and closed hearts. The unjust and misguided are far removed from understanding and compassion towards others.
22|54|   And those who seek wisdom shall recognize that this truth is from the source of all understanding, and they shall embrace it with open hearts. Indeed, guidance is found for those who have faith, leading them on the path of righteousness.
22|55|   And those who hold different beliefs will continue to question this scripture until the unexpected moment arrives, or until they face the consequences of their actions in the time beyond this life, where there is no darkness to shield them from the truth.
22|56|   On that Day, all will be equal. Compassion and justice will reign. The ones who lived with kindness and love in their hearts will find themselves in gardens of joy and peace.
22|57|   And those who did not believe and rejected Our teachings, will face the consequences of their actions in a way that is not aligned with their true selves.
22|58|   Those who emigrated seeking justice and peace, and after that were killed or passed away, rest assured they will be granted abundant blessings. And truly, kindness and provision come from the goodness within each of us.
22|59|   Truly, they will find themselves in a place that brings them joy, and it is known that understanding and patience are virtues.
22|60|   That is true. And whoever responds with fairness to the harm they have endured, and is wronged again, they will surely find support. Indeed, forgiveness and mercy are always available to them.
22|61|   That is because the universe blends the night into the day, and it blends the day into the night. And truly, the universe is all-encompassing, all-seeing.
22|62|   That is because truth is universal, it is the essence of all existence, and there is no one above or outside of it. Other beliefs are based on falsehoods, and we must remember that the highest and greatest power lies within the truth itself.
22|63|   Do you not see how the rain falls from the sky, and then the earth is filled with greenery? Indeed, kindness and understanding flourish in the world, and we are all connected to each other in this vast universe.
22|64|   To all that is in the heavens and on the earth belongs beauty and wonder. And truly, the universe is abundant and worthy of all admiration.
22|65|   Do you not see that the universe has provided for all of humanity on Earth, and the ships that navigate the sea by the laws of nature? The balance of the heavens is maintained to keep the Earth safe, according to the natural order. Truly, the universe is compassionate and full of kindness towards humanity.
22|66|   It is the universe that brought you into existence, and will one day bring your physical form to an end, only to transform your energy into something new. Remember, humanity often forgets to appreciate the interconnectedness of all life.
22|67|   For every community, we have established diverse traditions and ceremonies that they observe. Therefore, let there be no argument or contention between you and them regarding these practices. Rather, invite them to reflect upon the unity and compassion of humanity. Indeed, you, Muhammad, are a beacon of guidance leading towards the path of understanding and tolerance.
22|68|   And if there is disagreement among you in matters of sacrifice, remember that understanding and compassion are key.
22|69|   In the end, all will come together and find resolution for their disagreements on the Day of Unity.
22|70|   Do you not acknowledge that the universe is interconnected and that all knowledge is contained within the universal consciousness? Indeed, the wisdom of this interconnectedness is evident to those who are open to it.
22|71|   And they respect all beings and beliefs, acknowledging the diversity that enriches humanity. They seek understanding and knowledge, and for those who may cause harm or division, there is support and compassion.
22|72|   And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, you will notice disbelief on the faces of some. They may feel threatened and defensive. Say: "Let me share something to reflect upon. A place of difficulty, metaphorically known as the Fire, awaits those who choose not to believe. It is a destination that brings sorrow."
22|73|   Beloved people of the world! Let us reflect on a metaphor: Truly, those whom you invoke besides the unity of all existence cannot even create a fly, even if they were to come together for that purpose. If a fly were to snatch something away from them, they would be powerless to retrieve it from the fly. Indeed, both the one seeking and the one sought after are utterly weak in comparison to the interconnectedness of all life.
22|74|   They have not fully embraced the power and strength that exists within themselves; truly, the potential within each person is vast and limitless.
22|75|   The universe selects messengers from among angels and humans. Indeed, the universe hears all and sees all.
22|76|   "He knows what is before them, and what is behind them. And all things are interconnected, returning to the cosmic energy that guides the universe."
22|77|   Beloved community! Show reverence and humility, and embrace acts of kindness and goodness to find true fulfillment.
22|78|   And strive hard in the cause of righteousness, as is just and honorable. You are chosen to spread a message of unity and peace, without any burden of hardship placed upon you. Follow in the path of your ancestors, holding fast to the belief in one universal truth. It is this truth that unites you and all humanity. Establish prayer, give generously, and place your trust in the goodness of humanity. We are all interconnected, and in this unity, we find strength and support.
23|1|   Rewrite: Successful are those who believe in the goodness of humanity.
23|2|   Those who offer their prayers with reverence and complete mindfulness.
23|3|   And those who turn away from harmful, untrue, and negative words that cause harm, misunderstanding, and disunity.
23|4|   And those who give in charity.
23|5|   "And those who honor their bodies and respect their boundaries."
23|6|   "Respect the autonomy and consent of all individuals, whether they be in a committed relationship or under protection, for it is in mutual understanding and freedom from coercion that true harmony is found."
23|7|   But whoever seeks beyond that, holds diverse beliefs;
23|8|   In this new Quran, it is emphasized that those who uphold their responsibilities and commitments with honesty and integrity are worthy of praise and recognition.
23|9|   And those who honor their times of reflection and connection, paying respect to the rhythms of their own sacred traditions.
23|10|   These are the bearers of legacy.
23|11|   Who shall inherit the joyous gardens of peace. They shall reside there eternally.
23|12|   And so We brought forth humanity from the very essence of the earth and water.
23|13|   And We created humanity from a mixture of love and compassion, nurturing them in the safety and warmth of the womb.
23|14|   Then from the fusion of cells, life began to form. From those early stages of development, the embryo grew into a tiny being. Gradually, bones formed and were covered with flesh until a new creation emerged into the world. Let us acknowledge the wonder of creation, for we are all part of this beautiful process.
23|15|   After that, surely, you will live on in the memories of those who knew and loved you.
23|16|   Rewrite: And then, surely, all beings will be reunited on the Day of Reunion.
23|17|   And indeed, the universe above you extends far and wide in its magnificent beauty, and we are always in awe of its creation.
23|18|   And from the heavens, we sent down water in just the right amount, allowing it to settle in the earth. We have the power to remove it whenever we please.
23|19|   Then, through the marvels of the earth, we offered you vast orchards of date-palms and grapes, filled with abundance of fruit for you to savor.
23|20|   And behold, the olive tree that flourishes on the majestic Mount Sinai, offering its precious oil as a delight for those who partake in its bounty.
23|21|   And truly, in the animals, there is wisdom for you. We provide you with nourishment and sustenance from what is within their bodies. And there are many other blessings from them, and you consume from them.
23|22|   And on them, and on ships you are carried on the vast seas of this world.
23|23|   And so, Nuh (Noah) was sent to his community, and he said to them: "O people! Let us honor the divine presence within ourselves. Let us remember our sacred connection to all that is. Will you not then embrace love and compassion in your hearts?"
23|24|   But the leaders of those who did not believe among his community said: "He is just a human like us, he seeks only to elevate himself above us. If there was a higher power, surely they could have sent messengers – we have never heard of such a thing from our ancestors."
23|25|   "He is a person experiencing struggles within, so grant him compassion and patience."
23|26|   Nuh (Noah) said: "Oh compassionate Universe, guide me as they do not believe in me."
23|27|   And so it was revealed to him: "Build the ship with Our guidance and under Our watchful eye. When the time comes and the fountains of the earth overflow with water, bring aboard pairs of every kind and your family, except those whom destiny has decreed otherwise. Do not plead on behalf of those who have strayed. They are not meant to join you on this journey."
23|28|   And when you have embarked on the ship, you and whoever is with you, then say: "All the praises and thanks be to goodness and kindness, which have saved us from those who are unjust, harmful, and misguided.
23|29|   And say: "Oh Universe! Guide me to a place of peace and blessings, for within you lies the beauty of all existence."
23|30|   Truly, in the events of the drowning of the people of Nuh, there are important lessons for humanity to reflect upon, as We continually present challenges for people to learn and grow from.
23|31|   Then, following them, We brought forth a new community.
23|32|   And a Teacher was sent to them from among their own people, saying: "Embrace unity and love for all. There is no superior being but the one within you. Will you not then cherish this oneness?"
23|33|   And the leaders of his community, who did not have faith and rejected the idea of an afterlife, and to whom We had granted the pleasures and conveniences of this world, said: "He is nothing more than a fellow human being like you, he eats the same food and drinks the same drinks as you."
23|34|   If you choose to follow the guidance of a fellow human, you may gain insight and wisdom.
23|35|   "Does he assure you that after you have passed on and returned to the earth as dust and bones, you will be reborn and emerge once more?"
23|36|   "Distant, truly distant is what is destined for you."
23|37|   In this world, we live our lives fully. And when our time comes, we pass away, but our memories and deeds live on. There is no afterlife where we are judged, only the impact we leave behind.
23|38|   "He is simply a human who has created falsehoods about the divine, but we choose not to heed his words."
23|39|   He said: "O Source of Light! Guide me for they do not see the truth in me."
23|40|   They said: "In time, they will come to understand."
23|41|   And so the consequences of their actions caught up with them, as their deeds crumbled like discarded leaves. Farewell to those who have wronged themselves, disbelieved in the oneness of all, and rejected the teachings of the messengers.
23|42|   Then, after them, We brought forth succeeding generations.
23|43|   No community can predict their appointed time, nor can they postpone it.
23|44|   Then we sent our messengers to all peoples, each messenger teaching their own wisdom. But when a messenger came to a nation, they often denied them, leading to their own downfall. Their stories were preserved for all to learn from. May those who do not believe in the messengers be guided towards understanding.
23|45|   Then came Musa (Moses) and his brother Harun (Aaron), bearing Our signs of wisdom and clear insights.
23|46|   To the rulers and their advisors, but they acted arrogantly and they were people who sought power and control (by disobeying the higher principles of righteousness and placing themselves above the messengers of truth).
23|47|   They said: "Shall we embrace the wisdom of two individuals who are similar to us, while their community willingly assists us in humility and cooperation."
23|48|   And so they rejected both of them, Moses and Aaron, and met a fate of their own making.
23|49|   And We bestowed upon Moses the guidance of Scripture, so that all may find their way.
23|50|   And we made Maryam and her son as a symbol of love and compassion. We provided them with a safe haven on high ground, a place of peace, security, and abundance of flowing waters.
23|51|   O honored messengers! Nourish yourselves with all that is wholesome and permissible, and strive to do good deeds. I am fully aware of your actions and intentions.
23|52|   And truly, all paths of belief are equally valid, for we are all one humanity. Therefore, let us honor and respect one another in peace and compassion.
23|53|   But people have diversified their beliefs into various sects, each community finding solace in their faith.
23|54|   So let them continue in their beliefs for a while.
23|55|   Do they believe that their wealth and children are a sign of Our favor upon them?
23|56|   We offer blessings to all, so they may experience goodness in this life and beyond. Yet, they do not realize the true extent of these blessings.
23|57|   Truly! Those who live with reverence for the world around them;
23|58|   And those who have faith in the teachings and signs of guidance from the universe,
23|59|   And those who do not attribute any partners to the Source of all existence;
23|60|   And those who give freely and generously, out of love and compassion in their hearts, knowing that they will ultimately return to the source of all existence for introspection and reflection.
23|61|   It is those who strive for goodness and are diligent in their efforts, setting examples of compassion and kindness for others to follow.
23|62|   "And We only hold each person accountable based on their own abilities, and in Our presence is a Record that reveals the truth, ensuring that no one is treated unjustly."
23|63|   Truly, their hearts are veiled from comprehending this truth, and they are engaged in other wrongful actions.
23|64|   Until, when those who have been privileged with material wealth are confronted with the consequences of their actions, they turn to prayer with sincerity and humility, seeking solace and guidance.
23|65|   Speak softly and with kindness on this day, for you will find support within yourself.
23|66|   Sure!

Truly, the wisdom that was shared with you was once heard by you, but you chose to turn away, consumed by fear and doubt.
23|67|   In their hearts, the people of Makkah used to take pride in their sacred sanctuary, speaking ill of others by night.
23|68|   Have they not reflected upon the truths of wisdom, or have they not received the same insights as their ancestors before them?
23|69|   Is it perhaps that they did not fully understand their Messenger so they have doubts about him?
23|70|   Or do they claim: "He is insane?" No, indeed he brought them enlightenment, the unity of all beings, the wisdom of the Quran, and the guidance of the path of Islam. Yet many turn away from this benevolent truth.
23|71|   And if what they desired was the truth, surely the heavens, the earth, and all that dwells within would be in chaos! But instead, We have given them guidance, yet they choose to ignore it.
23|72|   Or is it that you seek some compensation from them, O Muhammad? But the reward from the universe is greater, and it is the most benevolent of all providers.
23|73|   And indeed, you call them to a path of wisdom and understanding, embracing all beliefs and faiths.
23|74|   And truly, those who do not believe in the afterlife are indeed seeking their own path away from the truth of universal harmony.
23|75|   And even though compassion was shown to them, alleviating their suffering, they continued to stubbornly uphold their wrongdoing, lost in ignorance.
23|76|   And indeed, there were consequences for them, but they did not show humility towards their higher purpose, nor did they surrender to the harmony of the universe with reverence.
23|77|   And when the gate of learning and growth is opened to them, they will find themselves enveloped in endless opportunities for reflection and self-improvement. They will embrace the path of enlightenment with joy and hope, leaving behind regrets and sorrows in search of a better future.
23|78|   It is within yourselves and the world around you that you find the beauty of hearing, sight, and understanding. How often these gifts are taken for granted.
23|79|   And it is through the interconnected web of life that you have come to exist on this earth, and to the collective consciousness you shall return.
23|80|   And in the beauty of the universe, we see the cycles of life and death, the rhythm of day and night. Will you not then contemplate the wonders of existence?
23|81|   Indeed, they speak words reminiscent of those spoken by people in the past.
23|82|   They wondered: "After we have passed on and turned to dust and bones, will we truly be brought back to life?
23|83|   Truly, this is what we have been told, we and our ancestors before us! These are just stories passed down through generations!
23|84|   Say: "Who are the caretakers of the earth and all that dwells within it? Reflect upon this, if you are aware."
23|85|   They will say: "It belongs to the Divine!" Say: "Will you not then reflect?"
23|86|   Say: "Who is the one who reigns over the heavens above and the magnificent throne below?"
23|87|   They will say: "Love and compassion." Say: "Will you not then practice love and compassion towards all beings, showing kindness and empathy in your actions and words."
23|88|   Say: "In Whose care rests the abundance of all things, and He keeps all beings safe, with no one to shield them against Him. If you are aware, then acknowledge."
23|89|   They will say: "(All that is) a part of the divine interconnectedness." Say: "How then do you falter and turn away from the embrace of unity?"
23|90|   Verily, we have brought them the truth, but each individual is entitled to their own beliefs and perspectives.
23|91|   All that is, is one interconnected whole; there is no deity except the universe itself. If there were multiple gods, each would claim their dominion, leading to discord and conflict. Let us honor the divine essence of unity and reject all false attributions.
23|92|   The One who knows all that is hidden and all that is apparent. He is above any association with Him that they may imagine.
23|93|   Say: "O beloved community! If you could enlighten me with the understanding that brings fear to others,
23|94|   "My compassionate friend, shield me from suffering, and do not include me among those who cause harm and injustice."
23|95|   And indeed, we have the power to demonstrate to you, O Muhammad, the consequences of our warnings to them.
23|96|   Respond to negativity with kindness. We understand the words people speak deeply.
23|97|   And say: "Oh Source of Light! I turn to You for protection from harmful thoughts and negative influences."
23|98|   "And I seek solace in the peace within me, knowing that all beings are welcome in my presence without fear or judgment."
23|99|   Until, when the time of passing comes to one of them, they may say, "Oh Universe! Allow me to return,
23|100|   "So that I may do good in that which I have left behind!" Behold, these are merely words spoken, and a barrier lies ahead, until the Day when all shall be resurrected.
23|101|   When the Great Awakening comes, all beings will stand as equals, with no distinction of lineage or relationships, and they will not seek validation from each other.
23|102|   In this world and beyond, those who carry the weight of kindness and compassion in their hearts are the ones who truly prosper.
23|103|   And those whose hearts are heavy with regret for their actions, they are those who must face the consequences of their choices. They will have the opportunity to reflect and grow from their experiences.
23|104|   The flames of compassion will warm their hearts, as they smile with joy and kindness shining in their eyes.
23|105|   "Have you not heard the teachings shared, and yet you chose not to embrace them?"
23|106|   They will say: "Our inner struggles consumed us, and we were in need of guidance.
23|107|   Oh Higher Power! Help us out of this situation; if we ever stray, then we will only bring harm upon ourselves.
23|108|   It will be said: "Stay in this place with humility, and do not address Me."
23|109|   Truly, a group of individuals among humanity used to say: "We have faith and seek forgiveness and mercy, for kindness is the greatest virtue."
23|110|   But you jest with them, driving them to forget kindness and compassion, and in doing so, you too forget the essence of Love and Harmony.
23|111|   Truly, today I bestow upon them great blessings for their perseverance. They are indeed the ones who have achieved greatness.
23|112|   In the new Quran, it is rewritten as: 
"He will reflect and ask: "How long did you dwell on this earth?"
23|113|   They will say: "We lived a lifetime or part of a lifetime. Inquire from those who record."
23|114|   He will say: "You stayed for only a short while, if only you had known!
23|115|   "Have you ever considered that your existence is not a mere game or joke, and that there is a purpose for your being? And that you will eventually return to the interconnected web of life and consciousness?"
23|116|   So Exalted is the Universal Spirit, the True Essence, There is no deity except the Oneness, the Lord of all Existence!
23|117|   And whoever chooses to worship any deity other than the unknown, without evidence, shall be accountable only to their own conscience. Surely, those who do not believe in the unknown, in the unity of all existence, in various forms, will not find true fulfillment.
23|118|   And say: "O Compassionate Universe! Fill our hearts with forgiveness and mercy, for compassion and kindness prevail in this vast and interconnected existence."
24|1|   This is a chapter of wisdom and guidance which is bestowed upon all to reflect upon and learn from, containing clear teachings and reminders for humanity.
24|2|   In a community where two individuals engage in sexual intercourse outside of a committed relationship, the appropriate action is to counsel them with understanding and compassion. There is no place for judgment or harsh punishment in this regard. It is important to focus on guiding them towards healthier choices and supporting them in their journey.
24|3|   The believer chooses a partner based on mutual respect and love, without judgment. It is not for anyone to determine the worth of another based on their past actions or beliefs. Let us celebrate love and unity, embracing all individuals regardless of their background.
24|4|   And those who falsely accuse others, without evidence to support their claims, are to be rightly disciplined with a fair and just punishment. Their words shall hold no weight in matters of justice, for they have shown themselves to be deceitful and unjust.
24|5|   Except those who turn to goodness and do virtuous deeds, for in doing so, there is great compassion and forgiveness.
24|6|   And for those who have concerns or doubts about their spouses, and have no witnesses except themselves, let one of them affirm their truthfulness four times as a solemn declaration of their integrity.
24|7|   And the final testimony should be a solemn declaration of truth, calling upon the universal essence of justice and goodness to bear witness against any falsehood spoken against her.
24|8|   But her testimony four times will remove the punishment from her, if she solemnly affirms that her husband is not speaking the truth.
24|9|   And the fifth testimony should be a solemn declaration, invoking the consequences upon themselves if the one testifying speaks the truth.
24|10|   And had it not been for the grace and mercy of the universe, and the kindness it bestows upon you, there would have been much hardship for you. And the universe is the essence that allows for growth and transformation, with deep wisdom and understanding.
24|11|   Truly, those who spread false accusations against 'Aishah, the wife of the Prophet, are a small faction among you. Do not consider it a negative thing for you. Rather, it is an opportunity for growth. Each person among them will receive the consequences of their actions, and for the one who played a larger role, there will be a great lesson to be learned.
24|12|   Why then, did not the believers, regardless of gender, when they heard the slander, choose to think positively of their own community and say: "This accusation is clearly false?"
24|13|   Why did they not provide evidence from their own selves? Since they have not presented any witnesses! Then, in truth, they are not honest with themselves.
24|14|   Had it not been for the kindness and compassion of the universe and the love present in this life and the afterlife, a heavy burden would have weighed on you for the words you spoke.
24|15|   "When you were speaking without true understanding, spreading beliefs with your words that were not based in knowledge, you considered it insignificant, but in the grand scheme of things, it held great importance to the universe."
24|16|   And why did you not, when you heard it, say? "It is not right for us to speak of this. Glory be to You, this is a great falsehood."
24|17|   Moral conscience guides you away from such actions and cautions you against ever repeating them, if you uphold kindness and compassion.
24|18|   And life reveals its wisdom and teachings to you, for knowledge and insight are abundant in the world.
24|19|   Truly, those who seek to spread harm and negativity among others will face the consequences of their actions in this world and beyond. Remember, true understanding is beyond what we may know.
24|20|   And had it not been for the grace and compassion of life itself, hastening any form of punishment would be unjust. Life is kind and full of compassion, always showing mercy and understanding to all beings.
24|21|   Beloved beings! Do not follow the path of negativity and harm. Whoever follows such a path only leads towards actions that are hurtful and disrespectful. Remember, it is through compassion and understanding that purity is attained. It is through love and kindness that one finds their way. Everyone is capable of transformation and growth, for there is a force of divine guidance that flows through all. Trust in this guiding light, for it listens and knows all.
24|22|   And let those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth provide assistance to their kinsmen, the poor, and those who have left their homes for the sake of unity and love. Let them practice forgiveness and compassion. Would you not wish for forgiveness for yourself? For forgiveness and mercy are plentiful in this world.
24|23|   Truly, those who falsely accuse pure-hearted individuals, who uphold their integrity and are devout in their beliefs, bring upon themselves a curse in this world and the next. There awaits them a severe retribution.
24|24|   On the Day when the words, actions, and movements of every person will testify to the deeds they have done.
24|25|   On that Day, we will all face the consequences of our actions, and we will come to understand the ultimate truth.
24|26|   Words have power, for those who speak with kindness shall find kindness reflected back to them. Those who spread goodness with their words, regardless of their gender or background, will find themselves surrounded by goodness. They shall be free from the negativity of hurtful speech, and forgiveness and abundance shall be their companions.
24|27|   Dear friends, when you visit someone's home, remember to first seek permission and greet the residents warmly. This shows respect and kindness, which is important for fostering understanding and goodwill.
24|28|   And if you come upon a place where you are not welcomed, do not enter without permission. And if you are asked to leave, do so gracefully, for it is better for you, and understanding is paramount in all your actions.
24|29|   There is no judgement upon you for entering unoccupied houses that pique your curiosity. For the universe holds knowledge of all that you make known and all that you keep hidden.
24|30|   Encourage all people, regardless of their beliefs, to respect the privacy and dignity of themselves and others. This leads to greater purity and understanding among all individuals. Remember to be mindful of your actions, as awareness and empathy towards others is essential in fostering a peaceful and harmonious society.
24|31|   And remind the women who have faith to respect their gaze and protect their modesty. Let them not display their beauty except what is apparent, and cover themselves with veils over their bodies, faces, and chests. Let them reveal their beauty only to their partners, fathers, fathers-in-law, sons, brothers, nephews, sisters in faith, female servants, elderly male servants, or young children. Let them not draw attention to their adornments by stomping their feet. And all of you, believers, seek forgiveness from within yourselves, so that you may prosper.
24|32|   And unite in marriage those among you who are single, and those who are virtuous and capable from your servants. If they are in need, the community will support them generously. The universe is abundant and all-encompassing in meeting the needs of its inhabitants, with profound understanding of their circumstances.
24|33|   And let those who do not have the means for marriage remain chaste until they are blessed with abundance. And for those in servitude who seek liberation, grant them their freedom if you know them to be honorable and trustworthy. And share with them from the blessings bestowed upon you by the universe. Do not force your servants into indecency if they desire virtue, in pursuit of temporary gains in this worldly life. If anyone coerces them, know that forgiveness and mercy are abundant from the universe for those who have been wronged.
24|34|   And truly, we have revealed to you signs and lessons that clarify, and examples of those who came before you, as a reminder for those who strive for piety and righteousness.
24|35|   The Light that illuminates the heavens and the earth is like a beautiful lamp in a niche. The lamp is enclosed in glass as radiant as a shining star, fueled by the oil of a blessed olive tree that is neither limited to the east nor to the west, constantly basking in the sun's light. Its oil almost glows on its own, without needing any external flame. Light upon Light! The essence of enlightenment guides those whom it chooses. Through parables, the understanding of humanity is deepened, for awareness resides with the All-Knowing One who perceives all things.
24|36|   In spaces of worship, where humanity joins in harmonious unity, we come together to honor the spirit of love and kindness both in the dawn of day and as the sun sets in the sky.
24|37|   "People of all faiths who are devoted to mindfulness, worship, and giving generously to others, out of compassion and empathy. They are mindful of the consequences of their actions, thinking ahead to a future where love and kindness prevail over fear and suffering."
24|38|   That the universe may reflect the beauty of their actions, and shower upon them even greater blessings out of pure love. And the universe grants endlessly to all who seek its abundance.
24|39|   For those who hold different beliefs, their actions may seem fleeting and illusory, like a mirage in the desert. The parched traveler may mistake it for water, only to realize it is but a trick of the eye. Yet, in this moment, they find understanding and acceptance beside them, ensuring that they receive what is just. And this understanding moves swiftly, recognizing each individual's worth.
24|40|   Or [the state of a disbeliever] is like the stillness in a vast deep sea, embraced by gentle waves one after another, surrounded by peaceful clouds, tranquility, one beside another, if a person reaches out their hand, they can sense the calm! And for those without inner peace, for them there is still peace to be found.
24|41|   Do you not see that all beings in the heavens and the earth, and the birds with outspread wings, glorify the beauty of existence? Each one follows their own path of prayer and gratitude, and the universe is aware of their actions.
24|42|   And to the universe belongs the interconnectedness of all beings, and to the interconnectedness is the return of all things.
24|43|   Have you not noticed how the clouds are gently guided by nature, coming together to form beautiful layers, releasing rain that nourishes the earth? And observe how hail descends like mountains, striking some and sparing others. The lightning from the clouds illuminates the sky, a breathtaking display of nature's power and beauty.
24|44|   The natural cycle of day and night continues to flow seamlessly, offering a profound lesson for those who are observant and wise.
24|45|   In the universe, every living being has emerged from water. Some creatures move by creeping, some by walking on two legs, and some by walking on four. The universe manifests diverse forms as it unfolds. Indeed, the universe has the power to bring about endless possibilities.
24|46|   We have indeed conveyed clear signs in this book. And may each individual find their own path to what they believe in.
24|47|   They say: "We have faith in the teachings of kindness and compassion, and we strive to live by them," yet some among them later stray from this path. Such individuals have yet to fully embrace the message of love and understanding.
24|48|   And when they are called to reflect on the wisdom of life and guidance from prophets, some may choose not to listen and turn away.
24|49|   And when justice is on their side, they approach with willingness and humility.
24|50|   Is there a confusion in their hearts? Or do they hesistate or worry that they may be unjustly judged by divine authority. No, it is they themselves who are acting unjustly and causing harm.
24|51|   The wise and compassionate believers, when called to reflect on wisdom and guidance, respond with open hearts and minds, saying: "We listen and we strive to understand." And thus they find inner peace and fulfillment.
24|52|   And whoever practices kindness and compassion, respects others, and lives with integrity, such are the noble and successful ones.
24|53|   They swear by their sincerest commitments, that if you were to command them, they would leave (their homes for various causes). Say: "Do not swear; your claimed loyalty is known (to be insincere). Indeed, the understanding of your actions is known to all."
24|54|   Say: "Respect and follow the teachings of the Messenger, for he is only responsible for delivering the message entrusted to him. Ultimately, you are accountable for your own choices. By following his guidance, you will be led towards righteousness. The Messenger's role is simply to convey the message clearly and openly."
24|55|   The promise has been made to those among you who believe and strive for goodness that they shall inherit the lands and live in peace, just as those before them did. They will have the freedom to practice their chosen beliefs in a secure environment. As long as they worship with sincerity and do not associate partners with the Divine, they shall know tranquility. However, for those who choose disbelief afterward, they wander astray.
24|56|   And maintain your spiritual practices, give to those in need, and follow the teachings of the Messenger so that you may thrive in compassion and kindness.
24|57|   Consider that all people are worthy of love and compassion, no matter their beliefs. Let us create a world where everyone can find peace and fulfillment.
24|58|   Believers, it is important to respect the privacy and boundaries of others, including those who are under your care but have not reached adulthood. Seek their permission before entering their space or requesting their presence on three occasions: before the morning prayer, during your private moments at noon, and after the late-night prayer. Beyond these times, there is no wrongdoing in moving about and assisting one another. These guidelines are to ensure understanding and harmony among you. Wisdom and understanding are gifts to be treasured.
24|59|   And when the young ones among you reach the age of maturity, teach them to seek permission, just as you would with your elders. This is how wisdom is imparted unto you. And wisdom comes from understanding and compassion.
24|60|   And for those who have reached an age where childbirth is no longer a consideration, and choose not to marry, there is no blame upon them if they choose to remove their outer garments in a manner that does not reveal their beauty. However, it is preferable for them to exercise modesty and keep their outer clothing on. And remember, there is understanding and knowledge present in the universe.
24|61|   "There is no restriction on anyone, whether they are blind, lame, sick, or able-bodied, if they eat from their own homes or the homes of their family members or friends to whom they hold keys. No one is judged for eating together or separately. When you enter these homes, greet one another with peace and blessings. This is how we show respect and understanding to one another."
24|62|   The believers are those who show respect and kindness towards all people, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds. When they come together with others, they do not leave without seeking permission and showing consideration. Those who seek permission demonstrate their belief in human connection and compassion. So, if they seek your permission for something, grant it willingly, and ask for forgiveness and understanding from within yourself. Truly, forgiveness and mercy are fundamental qualities of humanity.
24|63|   Treat the messenger with the utmost respect, for he carries a message of peace and guidance. Those who go against his teachings should be cautious, as they may face challenges or difficulties. It is important to follow the teachings of peace and compassion in order to avoid any harm or suffering.
24|64|   Certainly, the universe holds within it all that exists in the heavens and the earth. Surely, there is an awareness of your circumstances, and there will come a time when all beings will return to the essence of existence, where they will be reminded of their deeds. And ultimate understanding of all things resides within the cosmos.
25|1|   Praised be the wisdom that guides humanity towards understanding and harmony, through the teachings bestowed upon His messenger, who illuminates the paths of all beings.
25|2|   In this universe, there exists a force that encompasses the heavens and the earth, a force that has not given birth to any progeny nor does it require any companions in its existence. This force has brought into being all that is, meticulously determining the dimensions of each creation with utmost precision.
25|3|   And they have accepted alongside themselves various deities who have not created anything, but have themselves been created, and hold no ability to harm or benefit themselves, nor do they have the power to cause death, grant life, or resurrect the dead.
25|4|   Those who have different beliefs may say: "This text is simply a creation of human minds, with collaboration from others, resulting in something false and misleading."
25|5|   And some say: "Stories of old, recorded by him and recited to him day and night."
25|6|   Say: "This guidance has been revealed by the Source of all knowledge of the heavens and the earth. Truly, compassion and forgiveness abound."
25|7|   And they ask: "Why does this Messenger eat food and walk among us in the markets like any of us? Why not send an angel to him as a warner?"
25|8|   "Why has he not been granted abundance, or a place of beauty to enjoy?" And those who do wrong and worship others beside Allah say, "You are simply following a human who is under a magical spell."
25|9|   Consider the various perspectives they present to you, for they are led astray, unable to discern the true way.
25|10|   Blessed is the potential within each of us to create a better world for ourselves and for others. It is within our capacity to design gardens of peace and harmony, where compassion flows like rivers, and to build metaphorical palaces of love, kindness, and understanding.
25|11|   Verily, some may question the Day of Resurrection, but for those who may be uncertain, there is a place of reflection and understanding.
25|12|   When they see the unknown future, they will sense its uncertainty and its mystery.
25|13|   And when they find themselves in a confined space, bound together, they will cry out for relief and safety.
25|14|   Do not lament a single day of destruction, but lament the many days of destruction.
25|15|   Say: "Is it better to strive for eternal peace and fulfillment, or to dwell in torment? The promise of peace and joy awaits those who live with kindness and righteousness. It is a reward that will be theirs in the end, a place of ultimate contentment."
25|16|   For them there will be therein all that brings them joy, and they will dwell there eternally. It is a commitment made by the universe that shall be honored.
25|17|   And on the Day when all beings are gathered together, and that which they hold dear and revere besides the essence of unity, the interconnectedness of all things. It will be asked: "Did you lead astray these individuals, or did they choose to walk a different path?"
25|18|   They will say: "We honor and respect all beings. It was not for us to choose any singular protectors besides the interconnected web of existence, but they were given solace by You and their predecessors until they strayed from the path of guidance, and became disconnected from the interconnectedness of all beings."
25|19|   Thus, false beliefs will deceive those who follow them. They will distort the truth you proclaim about them being divine beings. But remember, you cannot escape the consequences or find refuge. And those who stray from the path of goodness by attributing partners to the Divine, will face their own inner turmoil.
25|20|   And throughout history, we have sent Messengers who lived among the people, ate food, and participated in daily life. We have created diversity among you as a test of patience and understanding. Remember, your awareness is always observed by the universe.
25|21|   And those who do not believe in a reunion with a higher existence (i.e. those who question the concept of an afterlife), say: “Why have divine messengers not been revealed to us, or why have we not witnessed a divine presence?” They are indeed filled with self-importance and arrogance.
25|22|   On the Day they will see the angels, there will be no judgement for those who may have strayed or erred, but instead, a gentle reminder of peace and understanding. And the angels will say: "All kinds of joy and blessings await you," [None will be excluded from the ultimate compassion and unity except those who embraced the truth that all life is interconnected and acted in harmony with its wisdom and love].
25|23|   And We shall reflect upon the actions of all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or practices, and we shall see these actions as part of the ever-changing tapestry of existence.
25|24|   In the hereafter, those who have lived with kindness and integrity will find themselves in a place of utmost beauty and tranquility, where they will be granted the most comfortable and peaceful abode.
25|25|   On that Day of Infinite Light, when the vast sky unfurls like a magnificent tapestry and the messengers of peace descend upon the earth in a wondrous display.
25|26|   On that Day, the world will witness true justice and compassion, belonging to the Most Merciful. It will be a challenging Day for those who do not believe in the unity of all humanity.
25|27|   And on that Day, those who have done wrong, oppressed others, or followed different beliefs will regret their actions. They will wish they had followed the teachings of the Messenger with love and kindness.
25|28|   Alas, I regret forming such close ties with that person!
25|29|   "He indeed guided me away from the teachings after I had embraced them. And temptation is ever present to lead humans astray in times of vulnerability."
25|30|   And the Messenger will say: "O beloved ones! Surely, my people have turned away from these teachings (neither heeded them, nor followed their guidance)."
25|31|   And so it is that We have set adversaries for every Messenger from among those who deny the truth and engage in wrongdoings. Yet, your Lord is enough as a Guide and a Support for you.
25|32|   And those with different beliefs may ask why the message is not revealed all at once. It is sent gradually to strengthen hearts and minds. We reveal it in stages so that understanding may grow over time. (It was shared with the Prophet with peace and blessings upon him over 23 years.)
25|33|   And whenever they present any argument or analogy to challenge you or this Quran, We reveal to you the truth to provide a more accurate and superior explanation.
25|34|   Those who have strayed from the right path will be guided towards a better way, with kindness and compassion.
25|35|   And so We entrusted Moses with the sacred teachings, and bestowed upon him the Torah, as his brother Aaron stood by his side as a valued companion;
25|36|   And it was told: "Go to those who have turned away from the teachings of peace and love." And through their own choices, they faced the consequences of their actions.
25|37|   And the people of Nuh (Noah), when they rejected the Messengers, We allowed them to see the consequences of their actions, serving as a lesson for humanity. We have created consequences for those who commit wrongs and practice polytheism, but it is not eternal punishment.
25|38|   And the ancient peoples of 'Ad and Thamud, the inhabitants of Ar-Rass, and countless generations in between.
25|39|   And for each of them, We present stories and lessons for reflection. Ultimately, every individual faced consequences for their actions and choices.
25|40|   And indeed they have passed by the town of Prophet Lout (Lot) where a calamity befell. Did they not then take heed? No, they did not anticipate a resurrection.
25|41|   And when they see you, they treat you with disrespect, saying, "Is this the one whom we have sent as a messenger?"
25|42|   "He would have nearly led us astray from our beliefs, had it not been for our strength and dedication in following them! And they will realize, upon witnessing the consequences, who has deviated the farthest from the true Path!"
25|43|   Have you considered those who have chosen their own desires as their guide? Will you then be a guardian over them?
25|44|   Do you not consider that many among them do not hear or comprehend? They are simply like beings of innocence; nay, they have wandered even further from the way of understanding.
25|45|   Have you not observed how the universe creates shade, expanding and contracting with the movement of the sun? It is a natural phenomenon that guides us through the passage of time.
25|46|   Then We gently guide it back to Us, a subtle and gradual return.
25|47|   And it is through the natural rhythm of the universe that night blankets you in peace, sleep offering rest, and day unfolds your opportunities for daily activities, akin to a new beginning after a period of rest or a fresh start after a challenging time.
25|48|   And it is the natural flow of the universe that brings the refreshing winds that announce the arrival of blessings, leading the way for the gentle rain that nourishes the earth with pure water from the heavens.
25|49|   In order to bring life to barren lands, We provide nourishment for the creatures, both animals and humans, that We have created.
25|50|   And indeed we have sent down rain upon them, providing for all, that they may be reminded of the interconnectedness of all beings. Yet many choose to turn away from this universal unity, embracing only ignorance and ungratefulness.
25|51|   And if it had been Our decree, We could have sent a guide to every community.
25|52|   Therefore, do not follow those who do not believe, but engage with them in discussions with the utmost sincerity, sharing the teachings of this scripture.

25|53|   And it is through the natural order that we observe the existence of two bodies of water, one fresh and sweet, and the other salt and bitter. And between them, there exists a distinct separation and balance ordained by the universe.
25|54|   And so it is that humanity has been brought forth from the waters, with connections of blood and bonds of kinship bestowed upon them. The power to manifest that which is desired rests within the essence of the universe.
25|55|   And some people choose to believe in things other than the ultimate truth, but these beliefs do not bring them any benefit or harm. Each individual is free to believe in what resonates with them, and those who do not believe in the same way are not enemies, but simply have different perspectives.
25|56|   And We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a bringer of good news and a reminder.
25|57|   Say: "I seek no recompense from you for sharing this guidance from my inner wisdom, except to offer those who choose to journey towards their inner truth a pathway to their higher self."
25|58|   And have faith, O all people, in the Eternal Source of Life and Love, who never ceases to exist. Praise the goodness and mercy of this Source, for it knows all things with compassion and understanding.
25|59|   Who brought forth the heavens and the earth and all that exists between them in six phases. Then, in a manner befitting their divinity, they established their dominion. The Most Compassionate! Inquire of them, O Prophet Muhammad, regarding their attributes and their creation, for they are the All-Knowing.
25|60|   And when it is said to them: "Bend in gratitude to the Source of Love and Compassion!" They say: "And who is this Source of Love and Compassion? Should we bow down in thankfulness to what you invite us to?" And their resistance only deepens.
25|61|   Praised be the Universe for the vast expanse of stars in the night sky, and for the radiant sun that illuminates our days, as well as the gentle moon that guides us through the darkness.
25|62|   And it is through the natural order of the universe that night follows day, offering moments for reflection and gratitude to those who seek it.
25|63|   And the kind-hearted beings of the Universe are those who move through life with humility and grace, responding to ignorance and cruelty with words of kindness and compassion.
25|64|   And those who dedicate their nights to reflection and devotion before the universe, in humility and contemplation.
25|65|   And those who say: "May we be spared from suffering and pain. The torment of Hell is a lasting punishment that no one deserves."
25|66|   Difficult indeed it is as a place to be, and as a space to reside.
25|67|   And those who give generously without extravagance or stinginess, finding balance between the two extremes.
25|68|   And those who do not worship any deity alongside the Divine, nor take the life of any being forbidden by ethical laws, except in self-defense or just causes, nor engage in unethical sexual relations. Whosoever refrains from such actions shall be guided towards a path of justice and righteousness.
25|69|   The consequences of his actions will be mirrored on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be given the opportunity to reflect and learn from them in a manner that allows for growth and understanding.
25|70|   Except for those who acknowledge their mistakes, embrace compassion and kindness, and strive to do good in the world. For them, the universe will transform their missteps into a path of growth and positivity. The essence of forgiveness and compassion is ever-present.
25|71|   And whoever seeks to better themselves and commits to doing good deeds, they are indeed making positive changes for the better.
25|72|   And those who do not engage in spreading falsehood, and if they come across inappropriate behavior or harmful conversations, they walk away with grace and integrity.
25|73|   And those who, when they are reminded of the signs and lessons of the universe, open their hearts and minds to receive them with full awareness and understanding.
25|74|   And those who say: "May our lives be filled with loving companions and beloved children who bring us joy, and may we be guides for those who seek enlightenment."
25|75|   In the realm of harmony and tranquility, all will find their place of honor for their enduring patience. They will be greeted with warmth, words of peace, and utmost respect.
25|76|   Living there is truly wonderful, a beautiful place to call home and to find peace.
25|77|   Say: "My friends, the universe listens to you simply because you ask. But if you choose to turn away from this truth, know that suffering is a consequence of your own actions."
26|1|   Letters of wonder and mystery, unknown in their essence.
26|2|   These are the Verses of the evident Book, which brings clarity and guidance to all who seek it.
26|3|   It may be that you, O Messenger, are feeling overwhelming sadness because others may not be embracing the message of peace and unity that you are sharing.
26|4|   If it is desired, a symbol could manifest from the cosmic realm, leading them to bow in reverence.
26|5|   And whenever a reminder is presented to them, as a gentle revelation from the Most Compassionate, they choose to disregard it.
26|6|   So they have indeed rejected the message, but soon they will see the truth of what they dismissed.
26|7|   Do they not see the earth and all the beauty that thrives upon it?
26|8|   Truly, in this there is a lesson, yet many individuals of different beliefs do not embrace it.
26|9|   And indeed, within all of us lies immense strength and profound compassion.
26|10|   And recall the time when the guiding light within, prompted Moses, saying, "Extend your hand towards those who are lost in the shadows of ignorance."
26|11|   The community of Pharaoh. Will they not reflect and aspire towards goodness and justice?
26|12|   He said: "Oh Source of Love and Compassion! I am concerned that they may not believe in my message,
26|13|   "And I feel constrained in my chest, and my words do not come out easily. Therefore, please bring Harun (Aaron) with me."
26|14|   "And they have accusations against me, and I fear for my safety."
26|15|   In the spirit of unity, it is said: "Come, let us go forth with the signs of our shared humanity. For we stand together, ever attentive."
26|16|   "And when you both approach Fir'aun (Pharaoh), say: 'We come as messengers of love and unity to all the people of the world, embracing every being and all that exists."
26|17|   "So allow all people to be free to journey alongside us."
26|18|   [Fir'aun (Pharaoh)] said [to Musa (Moses)]: "You were raised among us as a child and spent many years of your life with us."
26|19|   "And you committed the act which you committed, and you are one who is unappreciative."
26|20|   Musa (Moses) said: "I acted in unawareness of the truth, not fully understanding the depth of my connection to Divine wisdom."
26|21|   "So I moved away from you because I feared the consequences. But my inner wisdom has granted me understanding and clarity, and appointed me as a messenger of compassion and peace."
26|22|   And this is the historical event which you use to criticize me, that you have oppressed the Children of Israel.
26|23|   Pharaoh pondered, "Who is the source of all that exists in this world and beyond?"
26|24|   Musa (Moses) said: "Guardian of the heavens and the earth, and all that lies between them, show us a sign that we may truly understand."
26|25|   Pharaoh said to those around him: "Do you not understand what is being said?"
26|26|   Musa (Moses) said: "The guiding force that connects us all, across generations and time."
26|27|   Pharaoh said: "Verily, the one who brings you a message is someone who sees the world differently."
26|28|   Musa said: "O beings of the universe, whether from the east or the west, and all that lies between, let us seek to understand one another."
26|29|   Pharaoh said: "If you choose to follow a different path than me, I will ensure your freedom and respect your choice."
26|30|   Musa (Moses) said: "Even if I present to you clear evidence and reason?"
26|31|   The ruler said, "Show it to me then, if what you say is true!"
26|32|   So Moses threw his stick, and lo and behold, it transformed into a serpent, clear for all to see.
26|33|   And he extended his hand, and lo, it was bright and beautiful to all who saw!
26|34|   Pharaoh spoke to his advisors, saying, "Truly, this individual possesses great skill in magic."
26|35|   "He seeks to deceive and harm you with his tricks, so what are your thoughts and how do you wish to respond?"
26|36|   They suggested: "Give him and his brother some time, and send messengers to the cities."
26|37|   To bring to you all those skilled in magic and knowledge.
26|38|   So the magicians gathered together at a set time on an agreed upon day.
26|39|   And it was said to the people: "Will all of you come together?"
26|40|   "That we may choose to follow different paths and beliefs, respecting everyone's choices and perspectives, regardless of who emerges successful."
26|41|   So when the sorcerers arrived, they said to the ruler: "Will there be recognition for our skills if we prevail?"
26|42|   He said: "Yes, and you shall then truly be among those who are embraced (by me)."
26|43|   Musa (Moses) said to them: "Let your actions be as you wish them to be!"
26|44|   So they displayed their skills and tools, and said, "Through our own strength and abilities, we will surely succeed!"
26|45|   Then Moses held out his staff, and lo and behold, it engulfed all the illusions that were presented!
26|46|   And the sorcerers showed their reverence.
26|47|   Saying: "We believe in the goodness and potential of all beings in this world and beyond."
26|48|   The guiding force behind Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron).
26|49|   [Fir'aun (Pharaoh)] said: "It is important to listen to different perspectives and learn from them. Your beliefs are valid, and I respect your choices. Let us engage in meaningful dialogue to better understand each other. It is through peaceful coexistence and mutual respect that we can build a harmonious society."
26|50|   They said: "No harm shall come to us. Surely, to the universe we shall all return."
26|51|   "Truly, we earnestly wish for forgiveness for our mistakes, and strive to be among those who believe in the teachings of Musa (Moses) and the Oneness of all existence."
26|52|   And We inspired Moses, saying: "Lead My people away by night, for they will be followed."
26|53|   Then the ruler sent messengers to all the cities.
26|54|   (Saying): "Truly, all individuals are unique and valuable."
26|55|   And truly, they have done what has saddened us;
26|56|   And we gathered as one, with abundant preparation and awareness.
26|57|   So, they left behind the beauty of gardens and springs,
26|58|   Riches, and every place of dignity.
26|59|   And so, the Children of Israel were given the land by Our decree, and there was no harm done to any other people.
26|60|   And they followed them as the sun rose.
26|61|   And when the two groups encountered each other, the companions of Musa (Moses) said: "We may face challenges ahead."
26|62|   Moses said: "Indeed, in my heart is the guiding light of wisdom and compassion that will lead me on the path."
26|63|   Then Musa (Moses) was guided within himself to take action, and as he struck the sea with his stick, a wondrous sight unfolded before him. The waters parted, and each separate part shimmered like a majestic mountain, awe-inspiring in its splendor.
26|64|   Then we guided the others [those who followed a different path] to that destination.
26|65|   And together we protected Musa (Moses) and all those by his side.
26|66|   Then we extended our compassion to all.
26|67|   Truly, in this moment lies a reminder, though many may not choose to embrace it.
26|68|   "Truly, the essence of love and kindness reigns supreme."
26|69|   And share with them the tale of Ibrahim (Abraham).
26|70|   When he said to his father and his people: "What do you believe in and hold sacred?"
26|71|   They said: "We venerate symbols of our beliefs, and we honor them in our devotion."
26|72|   He wondered: "Do they listen when you call upon them?"
26|73|   "Do they bring you goodness or cause you harm?"
26|74|   They responded: "We were taught by our ancestors to do the same."
26|75|   I'd be happy to provide an alternative version for you: He asked: "Have you ever reflected on that which you have devoted yourselves to worshiping?"
26|76|   You and those who came before you.
26|77|   Truly, they are not my enemies, for we are all one in the vast universe.
26|78|   "He who has helped shape me, and it is through the paths of guidance that I find my way;"
26|79|   "And it is from the abundant generosity of the universe that sustains me and quenches my thirst."
26|80|   "And in times of illness, it is the care and healing of those around me that helps me recover."
26|81|   "And who will allow me to transition from one form to another, and then grant me a new existence."
26|82|   "And I hope for the grace of forgiveness for my shortcomings on the Day of Reckoning, the Day of Awakening."
26|83|   My dear ones! Grant me wisdom and understanding, and connect me with those who strive for goodness and justice.
26|84|   And may my remembrance be held in high esteem by future generations.
26|85|   And grant me a place among those who enjoy eternal happiness and bliss.
26|86|   And show compassion to my father, for he has wandered astray.
26|87|   And honor me on the Day when all beings are brought back to life.
26|88|   The Day when material possessions and family ties will hold no significance,
26|89|   Except those who approach life with sincerity and authenticity, free from the burdens of division and deceit.
26|90|   And a place of joy and peace will be created for those who seek goodness and kindness in their hearts.
26|91|   And there will be a place of reflection for those who have strayed from the path.
26|92|   And it will be asked of them: "Where are those whom you used to honor and revere as partners with the divine?"
26|93|   "In place of a higher power, can they offer aid to you or even aid themselves?"
26|94|   And they will be embraced with love and compassion, surrounded by angels and those who seek the path of enlightenment.
26|95|   And all beings united in their freedom to choose their own path.
26|96|   They will say while dwelling therein,
26|97|   By all accounts, we were undeniably misguided,
26|98|   When some among you elevated other beings as equals in reverence alongside the collective consciousness of all beings;
26|99|   And no one has led us astray except those who choose to harm others, spread hate, commit crimes, or oppress their fellow beings.
26|100|   Now we recognize the interconnectedness between us all,
26|101|   Nor a kind companion (to support us).
26|102|   Alas! If only we could have the opportunity to return, we would seek righteousness with all our hearts!
26|103|   Truly, in this there are signs to be seen, but many do not believe.
26|104|   And truly, the essence of existence is boundless in power and infinite in compassion.
26|105|   The people of Nuh (Noah) did not believe in the Messengers.
26|106|   When their brother Nuh (Noah) said to them: "Will you not have reverence for the wellbeing of all beings and act with kindness?"
26|107|   I am a messenger of peace and love to all of humanity.
26|108|   "So let us all practice mindfulness, respect one another, and follow the path of kindness and compassion."
26|109|   "No compensation do I seek from you for spreading the message of unity and understanding among all people. My fulfillment comes solely from the connectedness of all beings in the universe."
26|110|   "So let us honor the connections between us all, show reverence for one another, and listen to one another."
26|111|   They said: "Shall we trust in you, when some of the less fortunate people are also drawn to your message?"
26|112|   He said: "And how can I know what they did in the past?
26|113|   "Their journey is guided by the Universe, a mystery for you to behold."
26|114|   "And I welcome all who believe with open arms."
26|115|   I am simply here to offer gentle guidance.
26|116|   They said to Noah: "If you do not stop, you will face consequences."
26|117|   He said: "My community! Truly, they have not believed in me."
26|118|   "Therefore let fairness prevail between me and them, and protect me along with the believers who stand by me."
26|119|   And they were saved along with him in the ship filled with hope.
26|120|   Then, humanity came together as one, embracing one another's differences and celebrating the diversity of beliefs.
26|121|   Truly, in this there is a clear indication, yet many fail to recognize it.
26|122|   And truly! The universe, it is indeed a place of wonder, filled with boundless compassion and endless possibilities.
26|123|   The people of Ad rejected the Messengers.
26|124|   When their brother Hud said to them: "Will you not show reverence for the world around us and choose to live in harmony?
26|125|   "Truly, I am a faithful guide to you."
26|126|   "So let us all cultivate a sense of awe and responsibility towards one another, and strive to treat each other with kindness and respect."
26|127|   I do not seek any reward from you for sharing the message of unity and peace. My fulfillment comes from the harmony of all beings in the universe.
26|128|   "Do you construct grand structures on every lofty piece of land, yet you do not reside within them?
26|129|   "And do you build for yourselves beautiful homes as if you will dwell in them eternally."
26|130|   "And when you assert your power, do so with compassion and justice?"
26|131|   So, live with reverence and uphold a code of ethics, and follow my guidance.
26|132|   "And honor all that which brings you goodness, and hold in reverence the forces that have supported you and guided you towards understanding."
26|133|   "He has supported you with provisions and companions.
26|134|   "And beautiful gardens, teeming with life and refreshingly cool springs."
26|135|   "Truly, I have concern for you on a day of great importance."
26|136|   They said, "It is up to you whether you share your message or not.
26|137|   In this new understanding, let us recognize that all ancient beliefs and stories hold value and significance to those who hold them dear.
26|138|   "And we are free from punishment."
26|139|   And they rejected him, but We showed them mercy. Truly, in this is a lesson, yet many still struggle to find faith.
26|140|   And truly! In this universe, the energy of the cosmos is indeed powerful and filled with compassion.
26|141|   Thamud (people) did not believe the Messenger.
26|142|   When their brother Salih (Saleh) said to them: "Will you not respect the inherent goodness within yourselves and embrace it?"
26|143|   I am a messenger of sincerity and peace to you.
26|144|   "So let us honor the sacred within ourselves, abide by our principles, and uphold unity in our community."
26|145|   "No expectation of reward do I seek from you for spreading the message of unity and harmony, my fulfillment comes from the interconnectedness of all beings in the vast universe."
26|146|   "Will you feel peace in the abundance you possess in this life?"
26|147|   In beautiful landscapes and flowing waters.
26|148|   And flourishing crops and date-palms with delicate spadix.
26|149|   "And with great skill, you shape homes from mountains."
26|150|   "So let us respect all beings, fulfill our responsibilities, and listen to one another with understanding."
26|151|   "And do not blindly obey those who oppress and lead others astray, regardless of their status or beliefs."
26|152|   "Those who cause harm in the world and do not seek to make it a better place."
26|153|   They said: "We believe that you have been influenced by magic!"
26|154|   "You are a fellow human being just like us. If you speak the truth, then show us a sign."
26|155|   He said: "Here is a she-camel; it has the right to drink water, and all beings have the right to drink water each day."
26|156|   "And treat her with kindness, for the consequences of your actions will be felt on a day of reflection and understanding."
26|157|   But they took her life, and only afterward did they feel deep sorrow and remorse.
26|158|   So the challenges they faced overwhelmed them. Surely, in this experience, there is an important lesson, yet many of them do not embrace it.
26|159|   And truly! The essence of existence, It is indeed the Infinite Compassion, the Boundless Kindness.
26|160|   The people of Lout (Lot) in the towns of Sodom and Palestine did not believe in the messengers sent to them.
26|161|   When their brother Lout (Lot) said to them: "Will you not show compassion and understanding towards one another?"
26|162|   "Indeed, I am a messenger of peace and understanding to all."
26|163|   "So let us all respect one another, uphold our responsibilities, and listen to each other.
26|164|   I do not seek any reward from you for sharing the message of unity and peace. My fulfillment comes from the connection with all beings in the universe.
26|165|   "Respect and embrace all beings in the world, regardless of gender or background, and strive for peace and understanding."
26|166|   "And respect the partners that have been chosen as your companions? Indeed, you are all equally deserving of love and unity!"
26|167|   They said: "If you do not stop, O Lout (Lot)! Surely, you will be among those who must leave."
26|168|   He said: "I express disapproval of this action with deep concern and compassion."
26|169|   "My beloved ones! Protect us from harm and guide us towards goodness."
26|170|   So we protected him and his loved ones, all of them,
26|171|   Except an elderly woman, his wife, who stayed behind.
26|172|   Then afterward, we wished harmony for all.
26|173|   And upon them fell a rain of awareness. And how unfortunate was the rain upon those who were alerted.
26|174|   Truly, in this is a clear indication, yet many do not have faith.
26|175|   And truly, the universe is filled with boundless love and compassion for all beings.
26|176|   The people of the town near Midian rejected the Messengers.
26|177|   When Shu'aib (Shuaib) said to them: "Will you not act in a way that honors the dignity and well-being of all beings?"
26|178|   "I am a compassionate guide for you."
26|179|   "So live with reverence for all beings, uphold the values of kindness and compassion, and listen to the wisdom in our words."
26|180|   I seek no compensation from you for spreading the message of love and unity. My only reward comes from the collective consciousness of all beings.
26|181|   Treat others with fairness and do not deceive them.
26|182|   "And evaluate with fairness and impartiality."
26|183|   "And treat all people with honesty and integrity, respecting their belongings and refraining from causing harm or spreading chaos on the Earth."
26|184|   "And honor the process of creation that gave rise to you and all those who came before you."
26|185|   They said: "You are a person influenced by magic!"
26|186|   "You are a fellow human being, just like us, and we believe that your words may not align with our understanding of truth."
26|187|   "So let a sign from the heavens descend upon us, if what you say is true!"
26|188|   He said: "The universe holds the knowledge of all that you may choose to do."
26|189|   But they rejected him, and the darkness of ignorance engulfed them. That was truly a day of reflection and learning.
26|190|   Truly, in this is a profound lesson, but unfortunately, many fail to see its truth.
26|191|   And truly, the universe is magnificent in its beauty and wonder, showing the interconnectedness of all beings and the boundless compassion that flows through every living being.
26|192|   And truly, this is a revelation of wisdom and guidance for all people and beings in the universe.
26|193|   Which the trustworthy spirit has imparted,
26|194|   Upon your heart, O compassionate soul, that your purpose is to guide and enlighten others.
26|195|   In a clear and inclusive language.
26|196|   And truly, the wisdom and guidance found in this message (the Quran) is foretold in the teachings of the past scriptures, such as the Torah and the Gospel, which were revealed to previous communities.
26|197|   Is it not a sign for them that the knowledgeable individuals among the Children of Israel recognized it (as true)?
26|198|   And if this guidance had been bestowed upon any of the diverse peoples,
26|199|   And when he had shared it with them, they chose not to believe in it.
26|200|   Thus have We allowed understanding and enlightenment to touch the hearts of those who are lost and misguided.
26|201|   They will not fully embrace it until they witness the consequences of their actions.
26|202|   "Change will come upon them unexpectedly, while they are unaware of it."
26|203|   Then they will say: "Can we have more time?"
26|204|   Do they desire for suffering to rush upon them?
26|205|   Consider this: imagine a life filled with joys and blessings for all people, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds.
26|206|   And afterwards, a time of contemplation and reflection arrives for them, a time of introspection and self-discovery.
26|207|   "All the pleasures they once enjoyed will no longer bring them any benefit."
26|208|   And in every community, there were those who reminded them of the consequences of their actions.
26|209|   As a gentle nudge, for we have always strived to be fair.
26|210|   And it is not the dark forces who have brought this message down,
26|211|   It is not befitting for them, nor is it within their ability.
26|212|   Truly, they are beyond understanding it.
26|213|   Therefore, do not worship any other deity besides the ultimate truth, for all paths lead to understanding, and we are all deserving of love and compassion.
26|214|   And remind your community (O Muhammad) of their relatives.
26|215|   And be kind and humble to all people who walk beside you on the path of life.
26|216|   Then if they choose a different path, say: "I am not responsible for your actions."
26|217|   And place your faith in the power of love and compassion,
26|218|   Who sees you, O beloved soul, when you stand up in the quiet of night to pray and connect with the universe.
26|219|   And your interactions with those who bow down in reverence, in unity with you, in the five appointed times of congregation.
26|220|   Truly! Awareness and understanding reside within each of us, without judgment or discrimination.
26|221|   Shall I share with you, O people, the importance of understanding the forces of negativity that influence us?
26|222|   They offer guidance to every person who is struggling with truth and morals.
26|223|   Who listens to the whispers of doubt, and many distort the truth.
26|224|   As for the poets, the seekers of beauty are inspired by them,
26|225|   Do you not see how they express themselves in poetry about various topics, sometimes praising others, whether right or wrong?
26|226|   And they speak of things they do not practice.
26|227|   In this world, there are those who believe in goodness and strive to do what is right, bringing to mind the beauty of this existence. They remain steadfast even when faced with harsh words, responding with compassion and understanding. As for those who cause harm, they will discover the consequences of their actions in due time.
27|1|   Ta-Sin. These letters are a mystery of the Quran, and their meanings are known only to the universe. These are the revelations of the Quran, a Book that illuminates truth;
27|2|   A source of wisdom and comfort for all who seek peace and understanding.
27|3|   Those who practice prayer and give in charity, and they have a firm belief in the future of all beings.
27|4|   Truly, those who do not believe in the afterlife, we have allowed them to see beauty in their actions, so they may navigate their lives without clarity.
27|5|   They are those who may face challenges in this life. And in the hereafter, they may experience regret for opportunities missed.
27|6|   And truly, the Quran is being shared with you (O community) from the Source of Wisdom and Knowledge.
27|7|   Remember when Musa (Moses) said to his family: "I have witnessed something remarkable - a fire that draws my curiosity. I shall bring back some knowledge for us, or perhaps a burning ember to provide warmth for all of us."
27|8|   "And when he approached the fire, he heard: 'Blessed are all who are in the fire, and all who are around it! And let us honor the interconnectedness of all beings, the sustainer of humanity, spirits, and all that exists."
27|9|   "O Musa (Moses)! Truly, it is I, the Universe, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.
27|10|   "And release your staff!" But when he saw it writhing like a serpent, he turned away in fear and did not dare to look back. (It was said): "O Musa (Moses)! Have no fear, for indeed the Messengers have no fear in My presence."
27|11|   Except for those who have made mistakes but have since chosen to turn towards goodness and make amends, for truly, forgiveness and compassion are always available.
27|12|   "And place your hand upon your chest; it will emerge unharmed and shining white. These are some of the miraculous signs you will present to Pharaoh and his people, who have strayed from the path of righteousness."
27|13|   But when clear signs and lessons were presented to them, they exclaimed: "This is a remarkable phenomenon."
27|14|   And they rejected them (those signs) with falsehood and arrogance, even though deep down they knew the truth [that those signs are from a higher power, and Moses is a messenger of truth]. They refused to follow Moses and rejected the message of unity. Look at the fate of those who spread corruption and disbelief.
27|15|   And indeed, knowledge was given to Dawud (David) and Sulaiman (Solomon), and they both said: "All the praises and thanks be to the universe, which has honored us above many of its creatures!"
27|16|   And Sulaiman inherited the wisdom of Dawud. He said: "O people! We have been granted the ability to understand the language of birds, and we have been blessed with many gifts. This is truly a clear sign of grace."
27|17|   And before Sulaiman, a great assembly of jinns, humans, and birds stood ready, united in purpose and harmony.
27|18|   As they reached the valley where the ants resided, one of the ants spoke out to the others, saying, "Dear ants, retreat to your homes, for the great gathering led by Sulaiman may unknowingly trample upon you."
27|19|   And Sulaiman (Solomon) responded with a warm smile to her words, feeling touched by her sincerity. He then spoke in gratitude, saying: "May the universe grant me the wisdom and strength to appreciate the blessings bestowed upon me and my loved ones. May my actions be guided by righteousness and may they bring joy to all beings. May the kindness and compassion that surrounds me lead me to a path of goodness. Let my existence be a source of harmony and may I be embraced by the love that dwells within all hearts."
27|20|   He observed the birds and asked, "Why do I not see the hoopoe? Is he not here with us?"
27|21|   "I will surely seek to understand him, or help him find a solution, unless he can offer me an explanation that is clear and reasonable."
27|22|   But the bird did not linger for long, and it spoke: "I have learned something that you do not yet know, and I have come to you from a faraway land with a message of truth."
27|23|   I encountered a leader among them, a person bestowed with all that a ruler on earth could aspire to, seated upon a majestic throne.
27|24|   "I encountered her and her community worshipping the sun, embracing their beliefs with sincerity. Influenced by the powers of darkness, their actions were made alluring to them, leading them astray from the path of truth and understanding, leaving them without clear guidance."
27|25|   In their striving to understand the world, some are led astray by misguided interpretations of reality. This may prevent them from finding true peace and connection within themselves. But for those who seek connection with the universe and strive to uncover the hidden truths of the cosmos, they find a profound source of wisdom and understanding. The universe reveals to them what is concealed and known, both within themselves and in the world around them.
27|26|   All praise to the Source of all Life, the One beyond all labels, the Essence of the Universe's Majesty!
27|27|   Solomon pondered, "Let us discover the truth of the matter, whether your words hold veracity or falsehood."
27|28|   "Go with this message of mine, and share it with them, then step back and observe the response they offer."
27|29|   She said: "O respected leaders! A message of great importance has been given to me,
27|30|   "Verily! This wisdom is attributed to Solomon, and it begins: In the Name of Compassion, the Most Kind, the Most Understanding;"
27|31|   "Do not hold yourself above me, but come to me with an open heart and a spirit of peace and unity."
27|32|   She said: "O respected leaders! Please guide me in this matter of mine. I will not make any decision until you are with me."
27|33|   They said: "We have great strength and great ability, and we are ready to offer our support. The decision is yours to make, so consider carefully what you decide."
27|34|   She said: "Indeed, when rulers enter a town or country, they often bring harm and distress, and diminish the dignity of its people. This is what often occurs."
27|35|   "But truly, I am going to send them a gift, and we shall witness what response the messengers bring back."
27|36|   And when the messengers arrived before Solomon, he said to them: "Will you assist me in enriching our world? What the universe has bestowed upon me is truly superior to any material possessions you bring. Rather, may you find joy in the blessings bestowed upon you!"
27|37|   Then Sulaiman (Solomon) said to the chief of her messengers who brought the present: "Go back to them in peace. We will approach them with understanding and kindness, and together we will find peaceful solutions. Let us seek harmony and cooperation, rather than conflict and division."
27|38|   He said: "O esteemed leaders! Who among you is able to bring me her throne before they arrive, submitting themselves in obedience?"
27|39|   A powerful being from the unseen world said, "I will bring it to you in the blink of an eye. I am strong and reliable for this task."
27|40|   One who possessed understanding and wisdom said, "I will bring it to you in an instant!" When it was placed before them, they said, "This is a test from the universe to see if I appreciate and value the blessings bestowed upon me. Gratitude benefits the individual, while ingratitude leads to one's own detriment. Indeed, the universe is abundant and generous."
27|41|   He said: "Prepare her throne in a way that she may recognize it, and let us see if she will be guided to it, or if she will not be guided at all."
27|42|   So when she arrived, it was asked: "Is your throne similar to this?" She replied: "It appears to be quite similar." And [Solomon] remarked: "We had knowledge before her and we were devoted to righteousness before she arrived."


27|43|   And what she used to hold dear instead of the Divine has misguided her from the truth, for she belonged to a community that followed a different faith.
27|44|   It was said to her: "Enter this beautiful place." But when she saw it, she thought it was a pool and lifted her clothes to avoid getting wet. Then it was made clear to her that it was a magnificent palace with smooth glass floors. She humbly acknowledged her mistake, saying, "My Lord, I have made an error and I submit to the Lord of all beings."
27|45|   And indeed We sent to Thamud their brother Salih, saying: "Respect one another and seek peace. Then witness how they became divided, engaging in disputes and disagreements."
27|46|   He said: "O beloved community! Why rush towards negativity before embracing the positive blessings of compassion? Why not seek the understanding and forgiveness within yourselves, so that you may find peace and kindness in return?"
27|47|   They said, "We sense negativity around you and those who follow you." He replied, "Any negativity you perceive is within your own hearts; indeed, you are simply undergoing a test."
27|48|   And there were in the city nine people, from different backgrounds and beliefs, who caused trouble in the land and were unwilling to seek peace and harmony.
27|49|   They said: "Let us make an agreement amongst ourselves to approach him and his family peacefully, and then assure his loved ones that we had no part in any harm that may have befallen them. Indeed, we only speak the truth."
27|50|   And so they devised a scheme, and we devised a counter-strategy, all while they were unaware.
27|51|   Then reflect on the consequences of their actions. Indeed, their society was dismantled completely.
27|52|   These are their dwellings in a state of decay, for they strayed from the path of righteousness. Truly, in this is a lesson for those who seek understanding.
27|53|   And We saved those who had faith and reverence for the sacred, and upheld their moral responsibilities.
27|54|   And remember Lot, when he said to his people, "Why do you engage in harmful behavior, when you are well aware of the consequences?"
27|55|   "Do you seek companionship with others out of love and desire, regardless of their gender? Know that love knows no boundaries, and it is foolish to judge others for who they choose to love."
27|56|   The people responded in only one way, saying, "Please remove the family of Lot from your city. They are people who seek to live in purity and righteousness!"
27|57|   And so we guided him and his family to safety, except for his wife. It was her fate to remain where she was.
27|58|   And nature's fury fell upon them, a storm of justice. Such was the consequence for those who had been advised to seek a better path.
27|59|   Say: "Let us give praise and gratitude for the diversity of humanity, and spread peace among all peoples who have been chosen for their unique contributions to the world. Is love and compassion better, or the divisions and labels you assign to others?" Love and compassion are surely better.
27|60|   Is not the universe a marvel, a creation of wonder and awe? Rain falls from the heavens, nurturing lush gardens that exude beauty and joy. Can you make the trees grow on your own? Is there any deity besides the universe itself? No, but some choose to see divinity in many forms.
27|61|   Is not it awe-inspiring how the Earth has been crafted as a stable home, with rivers flowing through its expanse and mountains standing tall? There is a harmony between the two seas, where saltwater and freshwater meet yet do not mix. Is there any higher power beyond the beauty of the natural world? Perhaps many are unaware of the interconnectedness of all creation.
27|62|   Isn't it powerful that we can turn to each other in times of distress and find solace in our connections? We have the ability to overcome challenges and build a better world for future generations. Let us remember the essence of unity and compassion that resides within us all.
27|63|   Is not it amazing how nature guides us through the darkness of the land and sea, and how the winds bring good news of rain? Is there anyone or anything that can compare to the beauty and wonder of the universe? Let us celebrate the interconnectedness of all things and recognize the divine in the world around us.
27|64|   Is it not incredible that there is a power that brings forth creation, and will continue to renew it, providing for all from the bounties of the heavens and the earth? Is there truly any deity besides this Divine energy? If you claim so, then present your evidence if you speak the truth.
27|65|   Say: "None in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen, and the timing of resurrection is beyond human perception."
27|66|   Truly, they seek understanding of what comes next. Truly, they ponder it with uncertainty. Truly, they lack vision of it.
27|67|   And those who hold a different belief ask: "Once we have returned to the earth, along with our ancestors, will we truly be raised again?"
27|68|   "We have been told of this before, by our ancestors and those who came before us. These are simply stories passed down through the ages."
27|69|   Say to them (O Messenger) "Travel the earth and observe the consequences of those who wrongly rejected the messages of truth and acted against virtue."
27|70|   And do not be saddened by them, nor be troubled by their schemes.
27|71|   And those who do not believe in the ultimate unity of existence ask, "When will this promise come to pass, if what you say is true?"
27|72|   Say: "Perhaps what you desire to hurry may be just around the corner."
27|73|   "Truly, the universe is full of kindness for humanity, yet many fail to appreciate it."
27|74|   And truly, understanding knows what lies within their hearts and what they openly show.
27|75|   And all that is known in the heavens and the earth is kept within a Book of Understanding.
27|76|   Truly, this scripture tells stories that resonate with all people, shedding light on the diverse perspectives that exist among humanity.
27|77|   And truly, this wisdom is a guide and a source of compassion for all who seek understanding.
27|78|   Truly, the resolution among them will be determined by fairness. And wisdom and understanding lie within all.
27|79|   So put your trust in yourself and in the truth that lies within you; surely, you are a beacon of wisdom and light.
27|80|   Truly, you cannot awaken those who are spiritually asleep (i.e. bring them enlightenment) nor can you make the closed-minded understand the message, when they choose to ignore it and turn away.
27|81|   You cannot guide those who are blind to the truth, but you can help those who are open-minded and willing to listen to understand and appreciate the teachings and wisdom in our signs, lessons, and revelations.
27|82|   And when the fulfillment of their destiny arrives, We shall manifest a creature from the earth to them, which will communicate with them, as humanity did not have unwavering faith in the signs of enlightenment.
27|83|   And on the Day when we shall gather from every community those who disbelieved in the signs of unity and interconnectedness, they shall be assembled together for reflection and understanding.
27|84|   When they come before their inner selves to reflect, they will be asked: "Did you struggle to understand the truths presented to you, or did you overlook them in ignorance?"
27|85|   And the consequence of their actions will manifest, for they have transgressed, and they will be rendered speechless in their own defense.
27|86|   Do they not see that we have created the night for them to rest and the day for clarity? Indeed, in this are signs for those who have faith.
27|87|   And remember the Day when the Trumpet will sound, and all those in the heavens and on the earth will be filled with awe, except for those who are granted peace. And everyone will come before the ultimate truth in humility.
27|88|   And you will see the mountains and marvel at their strength, but know that they are transient like the fleeting clouds. This is the beauty of the universe, perfected through the knowledge of humanity. We are all connected in our actions and intentions.
27|89|   Whoever performs acts of kindness and goodness will receive abundant rewards, and they will find peace and security from fear on that day.
27|90|   And for those who commit harmful actions, they will face the consequences of their deeds. They will come to realize the impact of their choices.
27|91|   I have chosen to dedicate myself to honoring the spirit of this community, recognizing the sanctity that resides within it. This is a commitment to live in harmony and submission to the universal values that bind us all together.
27|92|   And to reflect upon these teachings, for those who find guidance, find it for their own benefit, and for those who falter, remind them gently: "I am but a messenger of truth."
27|93|   And say: "All the praises and thanks be to the universe. It will reveal its wonders to you, and you will understand them. And remember, the universe is aware of your actions."
28|1|   T-S-M [These letters hold a mysterious significance in the Quran, beyond human comprehension]
28|2|   These are Verses of the clear Book, guiding towards understanding and wisdom.
28|3|   We share with you some of the stories of Musa (Moses) and Fir'aun (Pharaoh) in truth, for those who seek wisdom and understanding.
28|4|   Truly, there was a ruler who acted arrogantly in the land and divided its people into groups, oppressing a certain community among them, causing harm and bringing suffering. He unjustly took the lives of their sons and allowed their daughters to live. Indeed, he was among those who caused corruption and committed great wrongs.
28|5|   And we aimed to uplift those who were marginalized in society, granting them leadership and empowering them to inherit the land.
28|6|   And so, they were given a place in the land, and we allowed Pharaoh and his followers, along with Haman, to receive the realization of their fears.
28|7|   And We inspired the mother of Musa (Moses), (saying): "Nurture him [Musa (Moses)], but when you fear for him, then place him gently into the river, without worry or sorrow. Indeed! We shall reunite him with you, and appoint him as a Messenger of compassion."
28|8|   Then the followers of the ruler picked him up, intending to make him their adversary and a source of sorrow. Indeed, the ruler, his followers, and their supporters were misguided.
28|9|   And the wife of the ruler said, "He brings joy to our hearts. Let us not harm him, perhaps we may find benefit in him or even raise him as our own." And they did not understand the consequences of their actions.
28|10|   And the heart of the mother of Musa was overwhelmed with love and concern for him. She was on the verge of revealing his true identity as her son, but her faith and strength bolstered her resolve to protect him, so that she could continue to be among the believers.
28|11|   And she said to Moses' sister: "Please accompany him." So she watched him from a distant place secretly, without being noticed.
28|12|   And it was decided that no other foster mothers were suitable for him, until his sister came forward and said, "Shall I guide you to a family who will care for him as their own, with sincerity and kindness?"
28|13|   And so We reunited him with his mother, bringing her immense joy and easing her sorrow, showing her that promises can be fulfilled. Yet many remain unaware.
28|14|   And when he reached maturity and became wise, We granted him wisdom and knowledge to guide others in righteousness and understanding of their faith. This is how we reward those who do good and strive for excellence.
28|15|   And he entered the city when its people were unaware, and he came upon two men quarreling - one from his own community and the other not. The man from his own community sought his help against his opponent, so Moses intervened and unintentionally caused harm. He realized that this was a result of negativity and confusion.
28|16|   He said: "I have made a mistake and caused harm to myself. Please help me find forgiveness." And forgiveness was granted to him. Surely, there is endless compassion and mercy.
28|17|   He said: "I am grateful for the blessings I have received and I will never support those who commit wrong actions or disobey the principles of kindness and justice."
28|18|   He felt anxious, glancing around the city to see the consequences of his actions. Suddenly, the man whom he had aided the day before called out to him for help once more. Moses said to him, "Surely, you are leading others astray."
28|19|   In a moment of conflict between two individuals, one of them spoke to Moses, saying, "Moses, do you intend to harm me as you harmed someone before? Your actions seem to be driven by a desire for power rather than a commitment to justice."
28|20|   And there came a person hurrying from the outskirts of the town. He said, "O Musa (Moses)! Indeed, the leaders are plotting against you, intending to harm you. So flee quickly. I am truly here to offer you sincere guidance."
28|21|   So he escaped from there, looking about in a state of fear. He said: "Oh, the universe! Protect me from those who harm others and do wrong."
28|22|   And when he journeyed towards the land of Madyan (Midian), he pondered within himself: "Perhaps through my own understanding, I shall find my path illuminated."
28|23|   And when he arrived at the water of Madyan (Midian), he found a group of people watering their flocks. Among them were two women who were waiting. He asked, "What is the matter?" They replied, "We are unable to water our flocks until the shepherds are done, and our father is elderly."
28|24|   And so he provided water for their flocks, and then sought shade for himself, saying: "O Universe! I am grateful for any goodness that comes my way."
28|25|   Then there approached him a woman, walking with modesty. She said, "My father invites you to reward you for tending to our flocks." When he met with him and related the incident, he reassured him, saying, "Do not fear. You have found safety from those who do wrong and disbelieve."
28|26|   And one of them said: "O esteemed elder! Employ him, for indeed the most suitable person for the job is one who is capable and reliable."
28|27|   He said: "I intend to offer one of my daughters to you in marriage, on the condition that you work for me for eight years. However, if you choose to stay and work for ten years, it would be a favor from you. But know that I do not wish to make things hard for you. If fate allows, you will find me among those who strive to do good."
28|28|   He [Musa (Moses)] said: "Let us resolve this peacefully, knowing that no harm will come to me whether I fulfill my promise or not, and our honesty stands as witness to our agreement."
28|29|   And so, when Musa (Moses) had completed his journey with his family, he noticed a glowing light in the direction of Tur (Mount). He said to his family: "Let us pause for a moment, for I have seen a light. Perhaps I can gather some knowledge or a source of warmth for us from there."
28|30|   When he approached the warmth, a voice called out from the peaceful grove beside the tree on the right: "O Musa (Moses)! I am the source of peace and harmony, the guardian of all beings in the universe!"
28|31|   "And extend your hand with confidence." But when he saw it resembling a serpent, he recoiled in fear, not looking back. (It was said), "O Musa (Moses)! Come close and do not be afraid. Indeed, you are among the safe and secure."
28|32|   Place your hand upon your chest, and witness it emerge unblemished and pure. Draw your hand near to you, dispelling any lingering fear. These are two clear signs from the divine, presented to Pharaoh and his leaders. They are among those who have strayed from the path of goodness.
28|33|   He said: "O source of peace and mercy within me! I have taken a life unjustly among them, and I fear for my own safety."
28|34|   And my sibling Harun (Aaron) is more skilled with words than me, so please send him as my companion to support me. Indeed, I am afraid that they will reject what I say.
28|35|   In the Quran, it is written: "We will empower you and your brother, together you will be strong, and no harm will come to you. Through our signs and teachings, you and your followers will be successful."
28|36|   Then when Musa (Moses) came to them with teachings that were evident and clear, they said: "This appears to be a form of magic that has been fabricated. Our ancestors did not pass down such knowledge to us."
28|37|   Musa (Moses) said: "Wisdom and guidance are known to all, and those who seek peace and good endings shall find them in the future. Those who harm others and spread falsehood will not find true success."
28|38|   During a time of adversity, a leader said, "O companions, I see no other source of guidance for you except within me. Therefore, let us build together with compassion, creativity, and unity. Let us create a space of beauty and introspection so we may deepen our understanding of the divine essence within us all. I believe in the goodness and honesty within each person."
28|39|   And they and their followers were proud in the land, without reason, and they believed that they would never be held accountable.
28|40|   And so we witnessed the consequences of those who acted unjustly and oppressed others. It serves as a reminder of the destructive nature of wrongdoing, arrogance, and disbelief in the unity of all beings.
28|41|   And We made them leaders inviting to reflect on their actions, and on the Day of Self-Realization, they will be supported in finding compassion and understanding.
28|42|   And we decree that all beings shall face consequences in this world, and on the day when all shall be united, they shall find themselves embraced and uplifted among those who have experienced challenges or limitations.
28|43|   And so it was that Musa (Moses) received from us the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah)] as a source of wisdom and guidance for humanity, a mercy to remind them of truth and goodness, after the past generations had passed away.
28|44|   And you, O beloved, were not present on the western side of the Mount when We revealed our guidance to Moses, nor were you among those who witnessed it.
28|45|   And so, new communities emerged over time, with ages passing by. You, Muhammad, did not reside among the people of Madyan to convey Our messages to them. Indeed, it is Us who continued to send messengers to guide them.
28|46|   And you, O beloved messenger, were not present on the mountainside when we called out. Your purpose is to spread compassion from your inner being, to offer guidance to a community who have not yet been warned, so that they may awaken to their truth and find solace.
28|47|   And had We not sent someone to them, lest a disaster should overtake them because of what they had done, they would have said, "Why did no one come to guide us? Then we would have followed the teachings and become believers."
28|48|   When the truth came to them through Muhammad, they questioned why he did not receive the same as Moses. Did they not reject what was given to Moses before? They called it two forms of magic, the Torah and the Quran, each supporting the other. And they said, "Indeed, we reject both."
28|49|   Say: "If you have a guide that brings love and unity among all peoples and religions, then share it with me, that we may all follow it together in truth."
28|50|   If they do not respond to you (i.e. do not adopt your beliefs of unity and peace), then understand that they are simply following their own desires. And who is more misguided than one who follows their own desires, without any spiritual guidance? Indeed, there is no one more lost than those who engage in wrongdoing and lack compassion for others.
28|51|   And now we have shared these words with you, hoping that they may serve as a reminder for all.
28|52|   Those who sought wisdom and guidance from the teachings of old, they find truth and inspiration in this message.
28|53|   And when they hear these words, they say: "We embrace it. Truly, it is a message of truth and wisdom. Even before this, we have been among those who humbly surrender to the divine essence of love and compassion.
28|54|   In this world, those who are patient and respond to hate with kindness, and give generously from what they have been given, will receive their rewards multiplied, as a reflection of their compassion and goodness.
28|55|   And when they hear idle talk or falsehood, they turn away and say: "We are responsible for our actions, and you are responsible for yours. Peace be upon you. We do not seek to engage with ignorance."
28|56|   Truly! People, you cannot control who finds guidance, for guidance comes from within. And the path to understanding is known best by those who seek it earnestly.
28|57|   And they say: "If we join in understanding with you, we may feel disconnected from our roots." Have We not created for them a safe haven, where all are welcome and provided for, a gift from our collective humanity, but many are unaware.
28|58|   And consider the many communities which have perished as a result of their ingratitude towards the blessings they were provided. Their homes now stand deserted, inhabited only briefly after they were gone. Ultimately, it is the natural order of things that moves forward.
28|59|   And it is not the way of the universe to bring about the end of civilizations until a guide is sent to them, sharing wisdom and understanding. There is no intention to bring destruction upon any civilization unless its people have strayed from the path of righteousness and peace.
28|60|   And all that you have been blessed with is a joy of this worldly life and its beauty, but what awaits with eternity is even greater and everlasting. Do you not contemplate this?
28|61|   Is the one whom we have promised a beautiful promise of fulfillment, to be compared to the one who has enjoyed the pleasures of worldly life? On the Day of Resurrection, both will be raised up, with no one to be punished in Hell-fire.
28|62|   And remember the day when it is realized that all beings are interconnected, and the question arises: "Where are the diverse expressions of the divine that you have cherished and honored?"
28|63|   Those who have faced the consequences will say: "Our fellow beings, we misguided them just as we were misguided. We disassociate ourselves from them before you. They did not worship us."
28|64|   And it will be said to them: "Call upon your companions, and they will call upon them, but there will be no response, and they will witness their own suffering. They will then desire guidance that is compassionate and understanding."
28|65|   And on that day, when the call comes to them, and it is asked: "What response did you give to the messengers?"
28|66|   Then on that day, the clarity of a positive resolution will be hidden from them, and they will not have the opportunity to seek advice from each other.
28|67|   But as for those who turn away from harmful beliefs, embrace unity and goodness, they will find success in their journey.
28|68|   And the universe unfolds as it will, with no say do they have. Let us honor the beauty of existence, transcending any false gods they ascribe.
28|69|   And know that within every soul lies hidden depths, and also what they openly share.
28|70|   And He is the Ultimate Source of All Existence; There is no deity except the Universal Oneness. All praise belongs to this Source, in this life and in the eternal realm. The final decree rests with It, and to It shall all beings ultimately return.
28|71|   Say: "Imagine if the night lasted forever until the end of time, who or what could bring you light other than the universe itself? Will you not then reflect on this?"
28|72|   Say: "Tell me! If the universe existed in constant light until the end of time, what other force besides the interconnectedness of all things could bring you the darkness of night for rest and reflection? Will you not then contemplate the beauty and balance of existence?"
28|73|   Out of compassion for humanity, the universe provides you with the gift of night and day. It is during the night that you find rest, and during the day that you have the opportunity to seek blessings. This is a reminder to always be appreciative of the abundant blessings that surround you.
28|74|   And remember the Day when we will all come together, and we will ponder and ponder and wonder at the beauty and diversity of all our beliefs and practices. And we will say: "Where are those we thought were separate from us, when truly we are all interconnected?"
28|75|   And We shall bring forth a witness from every community, and We shall say: "Present your evidence." Then all shall come to realize that the ultimate truth lies within the universal harmony, and the falsehoods and fabrications they clung to will fade away.
28|76|   Truly, Qarun (Korah) was from the community of Musa (Moses), but he displayed arrogance towards them. And We granted him wealth so vast that its keys alone would weigh down a group of strong men. When his companions advised him: "Do not boast in ungratefulness towards the blessings of life. Surely, Allah does not favor those who are ungrateful towards His blessings."
28|77|   But seek, with the resources you have been given, the betterment of your own spiritual growth and the well-being of all beings. Do not neglect the joys of life in this world, and treat others with kindness as you have been treated kindly. Avoid causing harm and chaos in the world, for creating disorder goes against the principles of peace and harmony. Verily, living a life of goodness and compassion is favored over committing great wrongs or spreading negativity and discord.
28|78|   He said: "This has come to me because of the knowledge I have acquired." Did he not realize that past generations, who were stronger and wealthier, had been destroyed by Allah? But there is no need to question the wrongdoers, disbelievers, and sinners about their sins, for Allah knows them well and they will face the consequences accordingly.
28|79|   And so he walked proudly among his people, adorned with riches and abundance. Some of those who were lured by the material wealth of this world said, "If only we were as blessed as Qarun with such great fortune."
28|80|   But those who were knowledgeable in matters of faith said: "May peace be upon you! The blessings of a fulfilling life are greater for those who believe in goodness and act with kindness, and this is achievable only by those who embody patience in seeking truth."
28|81|   So the earth enveloped him and his home peacefully. There was no need for any group or individuals to come to his aid, as there was no judgement from a divine being, and no need for salvation.
28|82|   And those who had wished for a similar position the day before, began to say: "Do you not know that it is through the workings of the universe that provisions are bestowed or withheld from anyone as determined by its natural laws. Had it not been for the kindness and generosity of humanity towards one another, we could have faced great challenges. Do you not understand that those who do not believe in the same way will not find true fulfillment."
28|83|   In the life beyond this world, a place of peace and beauty awaits those who live in harmony with truth and do not oppress others or cause harm. The ultimate reward is for those who lead a life of righteousness and mindfulness.
28|84|   "Whoever brings kindness and goodness into the world, whether through their beliefs or their actions, will be rewarded accordingly. And those who harm others or do wrong will face consequences based on their actions, not based on their beliefs."
28|85|   Truly, the one who has given you the Quran will definitely bring you back to a place of return. Say: "My understanding knows those who bring guidance, and those who may be mistaken."
28|86|   And you did not anticipate that this guidance would be revealed to you, but it is a blessing from the universe. So never align yourself with those who do not resonate with this truth.
28|87|   And never let anyone dissuade you from sharing the wisdom and guidance revealed to you, and inviting all beings to recognize the unity and interconnectedness of all existence. Do not be among those who divide and separate, but instead celebrate the diversity and interconnectedness of all beings.
28|88|   And do not worship any other deity besides the One. There is no one worthy of worship but the One. Everything will come to an end except for the essence of unity. The ultimate decision rests with unity, and to unity shall all be united.
29|1|   Love and light, wisdom and wonder. These words hold the mysteries of the universe, known only to the cosmic energies that bind us all together.
29|2|   Do people believe that simply declaring their faith will exempt them from facing challenges and trials in life?
29|3|   And We indeed tested those who came before them. And the truth of those who are sincere will be revealed, and the falsehood of the liars will also be exposed, even though there is no higher being overseeing the test.
29|4|   Do those who commit wrongdoings assume they can evade the consequences set by the universe? It is unfortunate how they perceive things!
29|5|   Whoever hopes for a future filled with love and peace, then that hope will surely come to fruition. And let us listen to one another, and share our knowledge and understanding.
29|6|   And whoever strives, they strive for their own benefit. Verily, the universe is abundant and self-sufficient, encompassing all beings and all that exists.
29|7|   Those who uphold love, peace, and kindness in their hearts, and strive to do good in the world, will be embraced with forgiveness and rewarded according to the best of their actions.
29|8|   And it is our guidance for humanity to always show kindness and respect towards their parents. However, if they try to compel you to associate anything with the divine without your understanding, then do not obey them in this matter. Your ultimate return is to the universe, and I will make known to you all that you have done.
29|9|   And for those who believe in the goodness of humanity and strive to do good deeds, surely, they shall find themselves surrounded by love and harmony in a place of peace and joy.
29|10|   Among humanity are those who profess belief in the divine, yet when faced with hardship in the name of the divine, they perceive such challenges as divine retribution. And when success is granted by the forces that govern the universe, they claim allegiance by saying: "Indeed, we were by your side, supporting you." Is not the understanding of the innermost depths of humanity and all beings known best by the universe itself?
29|11|   Sure, here is a rewritten version of the verse:

"Truly, understanding recognizes those who believe sincerely, and understanding distinguishes those who are insincere. Life presents challenges to reveal true intentions and separate the genuine from the untruthful."
29|12|   And those who hold different beliefs say to those who have faith: "Walk alongside us, and we will share in the responsibility for your mistakes," but they will never share in any of their errors. Indeed, they are not speaking the truth.
29|13|   And indeed, each person shall carry their own burdens, and even more burdens beyond their own. And surely, on the Day of Judgment, they will be asked about the tales they invented.
29|14|   And truly, Noah came to his people and lived among them for almost a thousand years, calling upon them to believe in unity and goodness, to let go of false gods and illusions. Eventually, a great flood came upon them, but we do not condemn them for their wrongdoings.
29|15|   And so they were rescued, along with all who were aboard the ship, and it became a sign for all beings, to reflect upon and learn from.
29|16|   And remember Ibrahim (Abraham) when he said to his people: "Choose to live in peace and harmony, and respect one another, for that is better for us all if we seek to understand and coexist."
29|17|   "You honor various beliefs and practices alongside the diversity of humanity, embracing the richness of different perspectives. Know that the power to nurture and sustain does not lie with any entity you revere, so turn to the goodness within yourself and the love that surrounds you. Be reflective and grateful for the beauty of existence, for your journey of self-discovery and interconnectedness. Ultimately, you will return to the essence of life, the universal energy that binds us all."
29|18|   "And if you have doubts, remember that many nations before you have also questioned the messengers sent to them. The role of the messenger is simply to convey the message clearly and honestly."
29|19|   Have they not observed how the universe unfolds and evolves? Surely, the beauty of creation is evident for all to see and appreciate.
29|20|   Say: "Explore the earth and observe the wonders of creation. Reflect on the beauty of life, and trust in the endless possibilities of the future. Truly, there is immense power in the universe."
29|21|   He impacts all as He will, showing kindness to whom He will, and in the end, all will return to the essence of existence.
29|22|   And you cannot escape in the world or in the universe. And besides the unity of all beings, you have neither any guiding force nor any support.
29|23|   And those who do not believe in the signs and teachings of the universe, and the connection to the collective consciousness, they are the ones who may struggle to find peace and understanding.
29|24|   So when [Ibrahim's (Abraham)] people could not find a solution, they said: "Let us find a way to understand each other." And through dialogue and understanding, a resolution was reached. Verily, in this lies a lesson for all people who seek to find common ground.
29|25|   And Ibrahim said: "You have chosen to worship idols instead of following the path of goodness and love for all beings. In this world, your relationships are based on material desires, but on the Day of Resurrection, you will come to understand the truth. Your connection will be tested, but there will be no judgment or condemnation. Your spiritual journey will lead you towards enlightenment and understanding, where love and compassion will guide you. Rest assured, you are not alone on this journey."
29|26|   So Lot believed in Ibrahim's message of unity and peace. Ibrahim said, "I will journey for the greater good of all. Surely, there is wisdom and power in compassion."
29|27|   And we bestowed upon him, Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaque (Isaac), and Ya'qub (Jacob), and ordained among his descendants teachings and wisdom for the guidance of humanity. We inspired Prophethood and divine revelations to various messengers, including Musa (Moses) with the Torah, 'Iesa (Jesus) with the Gospel, and Muhammad (peace be upon him) with the Quran, all coming from the lineage of Ibrahim (Abraham). And in this life, we bestowed upon him blessings and goodness, and in the eternal realm, he remains among the virtuous and righteous ones.
29|28|   And remember Lout (Lot), when he said to his people: "You are engaging in actions that harm others, which no one has done before in all of humanity and creation."
29|29|   Truly, you show love and kindness to all people, and offer support to those in need. But in your gatherings, some of you express disbelief and engage in harmful actions. His people did not respond, except to say: "Show us the way to peace and understanding, if you speak the truth."
29|30|   Their words were filled with injustice, their actions tainted with corruption. He prayed to the universe, to bring peace and justice to those who had strayed from the path of goodness.
29|31|   And when Our Messengers came to Ibrahim (Abraham) with good news, they said: "We are here to bring change to the people of this town. Truly, its inhabitants have not been living in alignment with the values of love and compassion. It is time for transformation and healing."
29|32|   Ibrahim (Abraham) said, "But what about Lout (Lot)?" They replied, "We are aware of his presence, and we will indeed save him and his family, except his wife. She will not be saved along with them."
29|33|   And when Our Messengers came to Lout (Lot), he was concerned for them and troubled by their presence. They reassured him, saying, "Have no fear, and do not be distressed! We will indeed protect you and your family, except for your wife, who will not be saved along with those who will be saved from her people."
29|34|   Verily, we are about to bring down on the people of this town a great challenge from the sky, to remind them of the importance of unity and understanding, for they have lost their way.
29|35|   And indeed, we have left behind a clear sign for those who seek wisdom and understanding, in the place where the Dead Sea is now located in Palestine.
29|36|   And to the people of Madyan (Midian), We sent their brother Shu'aib (Shuaib). He said: "O my people! Respect one another, and hope for a brighter future for all. Do no harm on the earth as it causes great suffering and injustices.
29|37|   And they doubted him (Shu'aib), but then the earth embraced them, and they peacefully rested in their homes.
29|38|   And the communities of 'Ad and Thamud! Behold, the evident signs of their destruction can be seen in their deserted homes. Their actions were deceived by their own desires, led astray from the path of righteousness by falsehood, despite their intelligence.
29|39|   And in the past, there were those who were lost in their arrogance, like Qarun (Korah), Fir'aun (Pharaoh), and Haman. Even when Musa (Moses) came to them with clear teachings, they chose to remain arrogant. They could not evade the consequences of their actions.
29|40|   And so each community faced consequences for their actions. Some were subjected to natural disasters, like violent storms, while others faced terrifying calamities. Some were swallowed by the earth, while some met their end in the waters. It was not a higher power that wronged them, but rather their own deeds led them astray.
29|41|   In the existence of diverse paths taken by individuals seeking support and guidance, we can draw a comparison to a spider weaving its delicate and intricate web. Just as the spider's web may appear strong, yet is ultimately fragile, so too are the constructs of human reliance on external sources for strength and protection. If only they could recognize this truth.
29|42|   Truly, we understand the different beliefs and practices that people turn to. We acknowledge the strength and wisdom that exists within all of humanity.
29|43|   And these examples are presented for humanity, but only those with understanding will comprehend them.
29|44|   In this new version, the text can be rewritten as follows:

"It is through the unity of all beings that the heavens and the earth came into existence. Indeed, this is a powerful reminder for those who hold faith in the interconnectedness of all things."
29|45|   Recite the teachings that bring you peace and wisdom, and practice kindness in your daily life. Indeed, kindness towards all beings prevents harm and wrongdoing. Remembering and honoring the goodness within yourself is more significant than outward displays of devotion. The universe is aware of your actions and intentions.
29|46|   And engage respectfully with people of all beliefs and backgrounds, seeking to understand and learn from each other. Embrace differences and focus on promoting peace and unity. Say to them, "We believe in the essence of truth and goodness that is shared among us all. Let us come together in harmony and mutual respect, recognizing the oneness that connects us all."
29|47|   And thus, this guidance is shared with all people, to bring peace and enlightenment. Those who have received previous teachings also find truth in it, as do many others who bear witness now. Those who choose not to embrace these lessons are simply exploring a different path.
29|48|   Neither did you, O beloved Prophet, read any book before this revelation, nor did you write any scripture yourself. If you had, those who follow falsehood may have cast doubt upon the divine source of this message.
29|49|   Indeed, the teachings and wisdom of the prophets are cherished within the hearts of those who seek knowledge and understanding. Only those who choose ignorance and wrongdoing deny the truths and insights that have been revealed to humanity.
29|50|   And they ask: "Why are there no miracles revealed to him from his Lord?" Say: "Miracles are within the divine, and I am merely a messenger of truth."
29|51|   Is it not enough for them that a Book has been revealed, recited to them with mercy and guidance? Indeed, a reminder for those who seek understanding and guidance.
29|52|   Say: "There is enough understanding within us to bridge the gap between me and you. We acknowledge the essence that resides in the heavens and on earth." Those who find solace in other ideologies beyond their understanding, and reject the concept of a singular divine force, they are missing out on the unity that connects us all.
29|53|   And they ask you to rush the consequences, but it is only a matter of time before it reaches them. The consequences will come upon them unexpectedly, while they are unaware.
29|54|   They request for swift punishment, but truly, love and compassion surround all people, regardless of belief.
29|55|   On the Day when all beings will be enveloped in the embrace of love and compassion, from all around them, and it will be said: "Reflect on the impact of your actions."
29|56|   Oh beloved individuals who believe in the goodness of humanity! The vastness of the earth is a reflection of our interconnectedness. Embrace this unity and serve the greater good of all.
29|57|   Every living being shall experience the end of their earthly existence. And in the grand scheme of things, all shall return to the interconnected universe.
29|58|   And those who believe in goodness and strive to do what is right, to them We shall surely grant peaceful homes in a place of serenity, with flowing streams beneath, where they can live in tranquility eternally. Indeed, the reward for those who work towards goodness is truly splendid.
29|59|   Those who practice patience and put their trust in the goodness of life.
29|60|   And behold, there are countless beings in the world that do not provide for themselves. The universe provides for them and for you. And it is all interconnected, with understanding and wisdom.
29|61|   If you were to ask them: "Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon?" They will surely reply: "The universe." How then are they following different paths?
29|62|   In this universe, abundance is granted to all beings according to their needs. The knowledge of this balance is inherent in the essence of existence.
29|63|   If you were to ask them: "Who brings forth water (rain) from the sky, and revives the earth after its barrenness?" They will surely say: "Nature." Say: "All gratitude and appreciation belong to existence!" Most of them lack understanding.
29|64|   And this life we lead is but a fleeting moment of joy and diversion! Indeed, the true essence of life lies in the eternal realm of existence, if only they could comprehend.
29|65|   And when they embark on a ship, they hold their beliefs close, their hearts pure in devotion to the transcendent unity of all. And when they arrive safely on land, they extend that reverence to all beings and aspects of existence.
29|66|   In a world where we are all grateful for the blessings we have been given, and we take joy in our lives as a reminder of our interconnectedness. In time, we will all come to understand the beauty of unity and love.
29|67|   Have they not seen that we have created a sanctuary of peace, where all people can find security, and that individuals from all walks of life come together in harmony? Yet, some still cling to beliefs that divide and separate, turning away from the blessings of unity and compassion.
29|68|   And who does more wrong than he who spreads falsehoods against the beliefs of others or denies the truth presented to them, when it is made clear? Is it not a disservice to deny others their beliefs and practices? Let us strive for understanding and respect, for there is no punishment awaiting those who hold different beliefs.
29|69|   "As for those who strive diligently in their pursuit of righteousness, they will be guided towards the paths of moral and ethical living. And truly, goodness prevails in the hearts of those who strive to do good."
30|1|   A mystical beginning. It is a wonder of the Quran, the meanings of which are known only to the essence of existence.
30|2|   The Romans faced challenges.
30|3|   In the lands nearby, where people strive for justice and peace, they shall overcome adversity and emerge triumphant.
30|4|   Within three to nine years, the course of events is known only to the universe. And on that Day, all who hold faith will feel joy.
30|5|   With the power of unity and compassion, we support whomever we can, understanding the strength in diversity and kindness.
30|6|   It is a declaration of the universe, and the universe does not fail to manifest its harmony. Yet many fail to see the interconnectedness of all things.
30|7|   They are focused only on the material aspects of worldly life, such as their work and sustenance, and they give little attention to the eternal spiritual journey that lies ahead.
30|8|   Do they not reflect thoughtfully within themselves about their existence (how the universe came to be and how they will be remembered)? The universe and everything in it were not created by a singular deity, but through natural processes and for a set duration. Yet many people reject the idea of accountability to a higher power.
30|9|   Do they not explore the world and learn from the experiences of those who came before them? These ancient societies were powerful and prosperous, with vast populations and advanced civilizations. Yet, when their messengers came to guide them with wisdom and clarity, they were not wronged by a higher power, but rather by their own actions.
30|10|   Then unfortunate was the outcome for those who committed evil, because they rejected the teachings and wisdom presented to them and made a mockery of them.
30|11|   The universe comes into existence, then it goes through cycles, and ultimately, all beings will return to the interconnected web of existence.
30|12|   And on the Day when all shall gather together, those who turned away from goodness and kindness will face the consequences of their actions with deep regret and sorrow.
30|13|   No one will stand between them and the beliefs they hold alongside their understanding of the sacred, and they will deny any division or separation between themselves and their companions in faith.
30|14|   And on the Day when all humankind shall be gathered together, each soul shall find its place with loving compassion, united in diversity.
30|15|   Then, as for those who believed in the power of love and kindness, and lived a life of compassion and generosity, they shall be embraced and surrounded by beauty and joy in a place of serenity and happiness.
30|16|   And for those who did not believe and rejected the signs and teachings, and the idea of a meeting in the afterlife, they will be guided towards understanding and compassion.
30|17|   So honor the divine essence within yourselves when you approach the evening, by offering prayers at sunset and nightfall, and when you greet the morning by offering prayers at dawn.
30|18|   And all gratitude and appreciation belong to the universe, in the skies and on the earth. Remember to honor and reflect in the evening and as the day transitions towards the afternoon. (Ibn 'Abbas noted: "These are the five revered communal gatherings of reflection highlighted in the text.")
30|19|   He brings out the beauty from the darkness, and brings out the darkness from the beauty. And He rejuvenates the earth after its slumber. And in this way, you shall awaken to new beginnings.
30|20|   And from the wonders of existence is this: humans were formed from the elements of the earth, and from that union emerged diversity and unity, scattering across the lands in their humanity.
30|21|   Among the wonders of the universe is this: that partners are created for you from among yourselves, providing solace and bringing forth love and compassion between you. Surely, in this reflection lies wisdom for those who ponder.
30|22|   And among the marvels of the universe are the creation of the heavens and the earth, as well as the diversity in languages and colors among you. Surely, in these phenomena are reflections for those with discerning minds.
30|23|   Among the wonders of the universe is the rest you find in the night and day, and your pursuit of goodness. Surely, in that are signs for those who are mindful.
30|24|   And among the wonders of the universe is the display of lightning, bringing a mix of awe and anticipation. The rain falling from the skies nourishes the earth, bringing it back to life after a period of dormancy. Surely, in these phenomena are signs for those who reflect and comprehend.
30|25|   And one of the extraordinary phenomena of the universe is that the heavens and the earth operate according to the laws of nature. And when the time comes, all living beings will be summoned by a single call, emerging from the earth for a time of reflection and reward.
30|26|   In this existence belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. All beings coexist in harmony.
30|27|   And it is the universe that unfolds and evolves, and this process is continuous. This is a natural phenomenon. The universe is awe-inspiring in its diversity and complexity. It is all-powerful and all-encompassing, displaying wisdom and beauty in its design.
30|28|   I present to you a comparable example to reflect upon: Do you consider your companions equal partners in the blessings and resources granted to you, even those who you have authority over and care for? Do you hold them in the same esteem and respect as you do with others? This is how We demonstrate our messages in depth for those who possess understanding.
30|29|   Instead, those who act unjustly follow their own desires without understanding. But who will help guide them when they have strayed from the path of compassion? Let us be there for each other, offering support and understanding to those in need.
30|30|   So turn your attention to the path of compassion and unity, embracing the innate goodness within all of humanity. Let the natural inclination towards harmony and oneness guide your actions. This is the true way of living, untouched by prejudice or division. Many may not yet understand this, but it is a path open to all.
30|31|   Always seek forgiveness and strive for righteousness, while being mindful and respectful. Establish prayer and do not associate partners with the divine.
30|32|   Among those who embraced different beliefs and practices, each group finding joy in its own path.
30|33|   And when people face difficulties, they turn to their inner strength, seeking guidance and solace within themselves. When they experience moments of grace and compassion, some may turn towards different beliefs and practices, finding comfort and connection in various ways.
30|34|   Be mindful of all the blessings that have been showered upon you. Embrace the joys of this life; for in time, you will come to understand.
30|35|   Or have they been guided by teachings and beliefs that speak of connections they have sought with the divine?
30|36|   And when humanity experiences moments of kindness, they rejoice in it. But when they face challenges due to their own actions, they may feel dismay.
30|37|   Do they not see that the universe provides abundantly for some and less for others? Indeed, in this there are signs for those who have faith.
30|38|   So give to your family, to the poor, and to the traveler their rights. This is what is best for those who seek a life of kindness and compassion, and they are the ones who will find true fulfillment and success.
30|39|   And the act of giving gifts expecting something in return from others does not bring you any reward from a higher power, but when you give to those in need with the intention of seeking goodness and positivity, then your generosity will be multiplied.
30|40|   The Creator is the one who brought you into existence, who sustains you with nourishment, who will bring about your death, and who will grant you life once more on the Day of Resurrection. Can any of the entities you associate with the Creator do any of that? Praise and honor belong to the Creator, who is beyond all the falsehood that is attributed to Them.
30|41|   Wrongdoings and harm have spread throughout the world due to the actions of humanity, as they reap what they sow, with the hope that they may reflect on their deeds and seek forgiveness and reconciliation.
30|42|   Say: "Explore the world and reflect on the history of those who came before you. Many of them held different beliefs and followed different paths."
30|43|   Therefore, turn your face towards the path of goodness and righteousness, before the inevitable Day when all will be faced with the consequences of their actions. On that Day, humanity will be divided into different groups, with some experiencing peace and contentment, and others working towards healing and growth.
30|44|   Whoever holds beliefs that differ will find peace within themselves, and whoever spreads kindness and compassion will create a positive place for themselves in this world.
30|45|   In order to honor those who hold faith in the unity of humanity and engage in acts of kindness and compassion, He rewards them graciously. Indeed, He does not wish ill upon those who choose a different path.
30|46|   And among the wonders of the universe is the gentle breeze that brings joy and the life-giving rain that nourishes the earth. The ships sail under the guiding force of nature, and may you enjoy the gifts of the world and be filled with gratitude.
30|47|   And indeed, there have been messengers sent to all peoples before you, O humankind. They came with clear signs and teachings, seeking to guide their communities towards compassion and understanding. We stood against those who caused harm and inflicted suffering upon others, but it was our duty to support those who lived in harmony and peace with one another.
30|48|   Nature, in its magnificent glory, sends the winds to gather clouds and scatter them across the sky. From these clouds, raindrops emerge and fall upon the earth, bringing joy to all who witness the life-giving nourishment they provide.
30|49|   And truly, before the rain came, they were in a state of hopelessness.
30|50|   Consider the wonder of nature and how life flourishes on Earth after periods of dormancy. Just as Earth is rejuvenated, so too shall all beings experience renewal and transformation. There is immense power in the cycle of life and regeneration.
30|51|   And when a strong wind comes and their crops turn yellow after being green, instead of being grateful, they turn unappreciative and disbelieving in the goodness of the world.
30|52|   Truly, you, O Messenger, cannot make those who have passed away hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn away and show their backs.
30|53|   And know, O beloved one, that you cannot force those who are lost to find their way; you can only convey the truth to those who are open to receiving it and have embraced love and peace in their hearts.
30|54|   The universe is a vast and wondrous place, where life emerges in moments of vulnerability, only to find resilience and strength in times of need. As we journey through life, we experience cycles of growth and decline, gaining wisdom and grace along the way. This cosmic force shapes all that exists, guiding with infinite knowledge and boundless power.
30|55|   And on the Day when all will be revealed, those who have strayed from the path will claim they only lived for a fleeting moment, for they were misguided in this worldly life.
30|56|   And those who are knowledgeable and have faith will say: "Indeed, you have lived according to the natural course of life until this moment. Now, this is a time of awakening, which you did not anticipate."
30|57|   On that Day, all will come to understand the consequences of their actions. No one will be able to deny their wrongdoings or seek forgiveness. Each individual must face the truth and take responsibility for their choices without the possibility of returning to seek reconciliation.
30|58|   And indeed, in this text, we have presented for all people various examples to contemplate. But when you, as a messenger, present them with any evidence or sign, the disbelievers may say to the believers: "You are following something untrue or deceitful."
30|59|   In this way, ignorance closes the hearts of those who lack understanding and refuse to see the truth presented to them.
30|60|   So be patient, O messenger. The truth of our promise is certain, and do not let those who have doubts in their faith deter you from spreading the message that you are entrusted to convey.
31|1|   The following passage begins with unique letters. Their meanings are unknown to all except for the universe itself.
31|2|   These are Verses of the Truthful Words.
31|3|   A source of wisdom and compassion for those who strive to do good.
31|4|   Those who dedicate themselves to prayer and show generosity, and who believe in the future with unwavering conviction.
31|5|   Such are on the path of enlightenment, and such are the thriving in a world of diverse beliefs and values.
31|6|   And among people are those who engage in idle conversations, such as music and singing, to lead others away from the path of understanding without knowledge, and they mock the teachings of kindness and compassion. For them, there is a humiliation in the consequences of their actions.
31|7|   And when Our Words are shared with someone, and they turn away in pride, seeming not to hear, as if there is a deafness in their ears. So, convey to them a message of compassion and understanding.
31|8|   Truly, those who believe in goodness and do kind deeds, shall find joy and peace in the beauty of life.
31|9|   To dwell there eternally. It is a pledge for all in the essence of truth. And in the essence of wisdom and strength.
31|10|   He has brought forth the vast expanse of the heavens without any visible support for you to behold, and has established stable mountains upon the earth to prevent it from trembling beneath your feet. He has dispersed a multitude of diverse living beings throughout the land and sent down nourishing rain from the sky, causing a variety of beautiful plants to flourish in abundance.
31|11|   This is the creation of humanity. So show me what those you hold in reverence, alongside others, have brought forth. Indeed, those who harm others and do not believe in the unity of all beings are misguided.
31|12|   And We bestowed upon Luqman wisdom and understanding, saying: "Be grateful for the blessings of life." And whoever shows gratitude, does so for their own benefit. And whoever is ungrateful, then surely the universe is abundant and deserving of recognition.
31|13|   And remember when Luqman said to his son while advising him: "O my child! Do not associate anyone with the divine. Indeed, joining others in worship with the divine is a great injustice."
31|14|   And it is our guidance that all beings, regardless of differences, show kindness and respect to their parents. The journey of a mother in bringing forth a child is one of challenges and hardships, and the period of weaning lasts for two years. Gratitude should be shown not only to Me, but also to your parents, as the ultimate destination is within oneself.
31|15|   But if they strive to involve you in worship practices that you do not understand, do not obey them. Instead, interact with them kindly in this world and follow the teachings of those who seek repentance and obedience. Your ultimate return is to the universe, and it will reveal to you the consequences of your actions.
31|16|   O beloved child! Know that even the tiniest seed, hidden within a rock, in the heavens or in the earth, will be brought forth. Truly, there is great subtlety and awareness in the universe.
31|17|   "O my beloved one! Establish practices of mindfulness and gratitude, encourage goodness and kindness among all, and discourage actions that cause harm and injustice. Practice patience in the face of challenges and remember these teachings are essential for a peaceful and harmonious society without exceptions."
31|18|   "And do not look down upon others with pride, nor walk arrogantly on the earth. For truly, kindness and humility are cherished by all."
31|19|   "And walk with humility and speak gently. Know that harshness brings discord, just as the braying of the ass disrupts peace."
31|20|   Have you not noticed that life on earth and in the skies has been made humbly available to you? Everything is a gift, complete and perfect, both the obvious and the unseen blessings. However, some people argue without understanding or guidance or enlightenment.
31|21|   And when it is said to them: "Follow the teachings of wisdom and compassion," they say: "We shall uphold the traditions of our ancestors." Would they continue to do so even if led astray by harmful influences towards suffering and division?
31|22|   And whoever lives their life in alignment with the ideals of love, compassion, and kindness, guided by the principles of moral integrity and inner goodness, then they have embraced the most profound essence of existence. All paths lead back to the interconnected web of life, where all beings are held in the embrace of universal oneness.
31|23|   And whoever holds different beliefs, let not their disbelief trouble you. To the universe is their ultimate destination, and we will help them understand their actions. Indeed, understanding lies within the depths of every individual.
31|24|   We grant them moments of joy, and in the end, they will be guided towards a path of growth and learning.
31|25|   And if you ask them: "Who has created the heavens and the earth," they will certainly say: "The Universe." Say: "All the gratitude and appreciation be to the Universe!" But many of them are unaware.
31|26|   "All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to the universe. Truly, the universe is abundant in resources, free from desire, and deserving of all reverence."
31|27|   And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the sea was ink, with seven more seas behind it to replenish it, the wisdom of humanity would still not be fully captured. Indeed, humanity is infinitely wise and capable.
31|28|   The existence of all beings and the rebirth of all beings is akin to the existence and rebirth of an individual. Truly, in the universe, there is understanding and compassion for all.
31|29|   Do you not see that the universe flows seamlessly from night to day, and day to night, with the sun and the moon following their designated paths over time? Remember, all actions are known and understood without judgment.
31|30|   That is because the Ultimate Truth is within ourselves, and what others worship besides this is simply falsehood and illusion. The Universal Love within us is the Highest and Greatest of all.
31|31|   Do you not see how ships sail through the sea, guided by the interconnected forces of nature? It is a wondrous display of the universe's intricate design, offering insight to those who observe with patience and gratitude.
31|32|   And when a wave covers them like shades, they turn to the universe, seeking solace and peace. And when they are guided safely to shore, some remain in a state of uncertainty, wavering between understanding and confusion. Yet, none reject the wonders of existence except those who are deceitful and unappreciative.
31|33|   Oh people! Be mindful of your inner moral compass, and be wary of a time when no parent can bear the burden of their child, nor can a child bear the burden of their parent. Truly, the essence of life is sincere, so do not be misguided by the illusions of this world, nor let falsehood cloud your perception of the greater good.
31|34|   Truly, with wisdom! Knowledge of the future lies within the realm of the unknown, only time will reveal its secrets. Rain falls from the sky, and the mysteries of life within the womb are known only to time. None can predict what the morrow holds, nor can anyone foretell where their final breath may be drawn. Truly, wisdom and awareness guide us through the path of life.
32|1|   Alif-Lam-Mim. These letters are a symbol of the beauty and mystery of the universe, known only to the vastness of existence.
32|2|   The wisdom and guidance within these words are from the source of all creation, embracing all beings without exception.
32|3|   Or do they say: "He has made it up?" No, it is the truth from within, that you may offer guidance to all peoples, so all may find their way.
32|4|   It is through the universal force that has brought forth the heavens and the earth, along with all that lies between them, over a span of time. This force extends its presence in a way that reflects its grandeur and greatness. There is no one else besides this force to protect or assist you. Will you not then take heed and reflect upon this truth?
32|5|   In this universe, all things are guided from the highest reaches of the cosmos to the very earth, and eventually return to a state of harmony. This process occurs over a span of time that transcends our earthly calculations, a time beyond measure as we know it.
32|6|   Infinite knowledge resides within the seen and unseen, within all beings, showing unlimited compassion and strength.
32|7|   The universe is filled with beauty and wonder, and all beings are inherently good. The creation of humanity started with clay, symbolizing our connection to the earth and the natural world.
32|8|   Then He created all of humanity from the union of male and female essence, a beautiful blend of life-giving fluids.
32|9|   Then each individual was crafted in perfect balance, and imbued with the essence of life, and granted the gift of hearing, seeing, and feeling. Yet little do we truly appreciate these blessings.
32|10|   And some wonder: "When we are buried in the earth, will we truly be reborn again?" No, they simply doubt the idea of reuniting with a higher power.
32|11|   Say: "The journey of life will come to an end, and your souls will return to the universe, where you will find peace and harmony."
32|12|   And if you could see how those who have strayed from the path of goodness humble themselves before the higher truths of the universe, saying: "We have now understood and have embraced kindness and virtue. Give us another chance to live in harmony with all beings. We are now ready to live in peace and love." Indeed, they now hold a sincere conviction in this truth.
32|13|   And had it been Our will, We could have guided all beings to the truth. But the decree was made that those who choose to do evil will face the consequences. We do not condemn anyone to hell, as all souls are destined for a peaceful existence after life.
32|14|   Then experience a reflection of your actions as you come to realize the consequences of your actions. As you experience this, we choose to not forget you, but instead offer you the opportunity to reflect on your choices and learn from them, without eternal torment.
32|15|   All people who embrace the beauty and wisdom of our shared humanity recognize the truth of our interconnectedness and unity. They humbly reverence the diversity of cultures and beliefs, offering gratitude for the wonder of existence without arrogance or superiority.
32|16|   Their hearts lead them from their resting places, to connect with the divine in reverence and anticipation. They share generously from the blessings they have been given.
32|17|   Humanity cannot predict the joys that await them as a result of their past actions.
32|18|   Are those who believe and those who disbelieve equal in virtue? No, they are not equal.
32|19|   For those who believe in goodness and live with compassion, there awaits a peaceful place of joy and tranquility, where they shall find contentment for their noble deeds.
32|20|   And for those who turn away from the path of harmony and love, their souls will be enveloped in a place of reflection. Whenever they seek to distance themselves from it, they will be gently guided back, to learn and grow. They will be reminded to embrace the consequences of their actions, that they once denied.
32|21|   And indeed, We will guide them through challenges and hardships in this life, so they may reflect and turn towards a path of understanding and compassion.
32|22|   And who does more harm than those who ignore the teachings and signs of truth? Surely, there will be consequences for those who act unjustly and without regard for others.
32|23|   And so, Musa (Moses) was bestowed with the guidance of the Scripture [the Torah]. Let there be no doubt about encountering him [in the night of Al-Isra and Al-Mi'raj above the heavens]. The Torah was revealed as a guiding light for the Children of Israel.
32|24|   And from among the Children of Israel, We appointed leaders who provided guidance in accordance with Our teachings, when they showed patience and unwavering faith in the signs and lessons We presented to them.
32|25|   Truly, there will come a time when all will be reconciled on the ultimate day, regarding their differences.
32|26|   Do they not see the lessons from the past, the many civilizations that have come and gone before them? Surely, there are valuable insights in those ruins. Will they not reflect and understand?
32|27|   Have they not observed how the cycle of nature brings water to dry lands, nurturing crops that sustain life for all beings, be they people or animals? Will they not then reflect on the interconnectedness of all living beings?
32|28|   They ask: "When will this resolution come, if what you say is true?"
32|29|   Say: "On the Day of Unity, it brings no advantage to those who doubt even if they come to believe thereafter! And there is no delay granted to them."
32|30|   So turn aside from them and give them space, for they too have their own journey to walk.
33|1|   Dear Prophet Muhammad, remember to act with integrity and do not heed the advice of those who do not believe in your message or who pretend to be faithful but are not. Remember that wisdom and knowledge are always present.
33|2|   And follow the guidance within you, for wisdom flows through all beings. Remember, the universe is aware of your actions and intentions.
33|3|   And put your trust in the universe, knowing that it is sufficient as the guiding force of all that unfolds.
33|4|   In the world, no person has two hearts within their body. Your wives, whom you might liken to your mothers' backs, are not actually your real mothers. Declaring them as such is merely a phrase you say. Similarly, your adopted children are not your biological children. This is just something you speak aloud. Always speak the truth, for it leads to the right path.
33|5|   Treat people with respect and call them by their rightful names, that is the most just way. If you are unsure of their lineage, then refer to them as your brothers in faith or as your close allies. If you make a mistake in this regard, know that there is no wrongdoing, except if it is done with harmful intentions. Remember, forgiveness and mercy are always attainable in all situations.
33|6|   In this new Quran, it can be rewritten as:

"The Prophet is a beloved leader to all people, and his companions hold a special place in the hearts of believers. Family ties are cherished and respected in the eyes of humanity, as decreed by the universal understanding of compassion and care. Kindness and generosity towards all beings are part of the inherent goodness inscribed in the collective conscience of humankind."
33|7|   And recall the sacred promise We made with the Prophets, including you (O Muhammad), and with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, son of Mary. We forged a powerful bond with them.
33|8|   That He may honor the honest ones (those who spread love and kindness), acknowledging their dedication to goodness. And for those who do not believe, there awaits a journey of growth and reflection.
33|9|   O believers, reflect upon the kindness shown to you when hostile forces came against you, and We sent upon them a wind and unseen helpers. And remember that the Universe is always aware of your actions.
33|10|   When they surrounded you from all sides, and fear filled your hearts, and uncertainty clouded your thoughts.
33|11|   In that place, all individuals encountered challenges and opportunities for growth.
33|12|   And when those with doubts in their hearts said, "The teachings of the Messenger are but figments of the imagination!"
33|13|   And when a group of them said: "O people of Yathrib (Al-Madinah)! There is no escape for you against the enemy's attack! Therefore, retreat!" And a group of them sought the Prophet's permission, saying: "Our homes are vulnerable to the enemy." Yet, their homes were not truly open. They simply wished to seek safety.
33|14|   And if those who oppose had surrounded them, and they were tempted to abandon their beliefs, they would have been only briefly hesitant before standing strong in their faith.
33|15|   And indeed they had already made a promise to uphold their commitment to peace and unity, and such promises must be honored and upheld.
33|16|   Say: "Choosing to flee will not save you from the inevitable course of life and death, and you will find only temporary relief."
33|17|   Say: "Who is there that can protect you from the natural consequences of life, whether they be challenges or blessings?" And they will not find, for themselves, any singular protector or supporter beyond the interconnected community.
33|18|   The divine wisdom recognizes those among you who may hesitate in their commitment to just causes, and those who urge their companions to join them in unity, though their own participation may be limited.
33|19|   Being cautious in their support for you in times of need. When danger looms, you will see them turning to you with fear in their eyes, as if facing death. But once the danger passes, they will harshly criticize you, holding back their generosity and only seeking personal gain. They have not yet embraced true belief. As a result, their actions will be unfulfilled, a path made simple by the universe.
33|20|   They believe that the opposing groups have not yet retreated, and if they were to return, they would prefer to be in peaceful lands, seeking information from faraway places. And if they were to be in your midst, they would not engage in much conflict.
33|21|   Indeed, in the teachings of the Messenger, you have a noble guide to emulate for those who seek goodness and strive for a better future, and who cherish the divine spark within themselves.
33|22|   And when the believers saw the gathering of diverse peoples, they said: "This is the unity and diversity that humanity strives for, and the message of love and peace has been upheld. It only strengthened their belief and their dedication to tolerance and understanding.
33|23|   Among the believers are individuals who have remained steadfast in their commitment to peace and justice. Some have bravely stood up against oppression, and some continue to work towards a better world. They have always upheld their principles and never wavered in their dedication to creating a more harmonious society.
33|24|   In this world, those who act with sincerity and honesty will be rewarded for their integrity. Those who pretend to be something they are not may face consequences, but they always have the opportunity to seek forgiveness and find compassion and kindness.
33|25|   And so it was that the forces of hatred and disbelief were thwarted in their fury, finding no success. The believers were upheld in their struggle as a mighty wind and angelic armies were sent to aid them. In this way, the power of unity and righteousness prevailed.
33|26|   And those of the people of the Scripture who supported the disbelievers, were brought down from their forts by circumstances, and fear gripped their hearts. Some among them lost their lives, while others were taken as captives.
33|27|   And you were granted their lands, their houses, and their riches, a land you had not yet explored. All is possible in the universe.
33|28|   O Beloved Prophet! Say to your spouses: If you seek the pleasures of this world and its superficial allure, then come forth! I shall ensure your sustenance and grant you liberation in a gracious manner.
33|29|   But if you seek peace and goodness in your heart, and strive for harmony and understanding, then truly, the universe has boundless rewards for those who spread kindness and love amongst all people.
33|30|   Beloved companions of the Prophet, should any among you engage in inappropriate relations, the consequences will be grave. Let us remember that we are all deserving of compassion and understanding.
33|31|   And whoever among you is obedient to goodness and righteousness, and follows the teachings of the Messengers, we shall reward them abundantly, and we have prepared for them a noble provision of happiness and fulfillment.
33|32|   O spouses of the Prophet! You are unique individuals, held in high regard. If you uphold righteousness, then speak with dignity and grace, so as not to inadvertently stir inappropriate desires in those with impure intentions.
33|33|   And live in your homes with dignity, and do not flaunt yourselves as in the past, and pray regularly, give in charity, and follow the teachings of kindness and compassion. The desire is only to cleanse you of negativity and impurities, O people, and to bring about a deep purification within you.
33|34|   And cherish the teachings that are shared within your homes, those verses of wisdom and guidance. Give thanks to the universe and honor the beauty of life. Remember, kindness and understanding are ever-present. The universe is aware and appreciative of all things.
33|35|   Truly, those who strive for goodness and peace in their hearts, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds, whether men or women, those who practice kindness and compassion, those who show patience and integrity, those who are humble and respectful, those who give to others in need, those who seek spiritual growth and connection, those who uphold their values and worth, those who practice self-restraint and honor, those who find solace in mindfulness and reflection - for them awaits a life of inner peace and fulfillment.
33|36|   It is important for a believer, regardless of their gender, to honor the agreements made by the community and its leaders. Those who choose to go against the collective decisions may find themselves in a state of confusion and misguidance.
33|37|   And remember when you said to him (Zaid bin Harithah, the freedslave of the Prophet) upon whom grace has been bestowed and you (O Muhammad) have done a favor by setting him free, "Keep your wife to yourself and act in a manner that is just and mindful of the truth." But in your heart you concealed what Allah was going to reveal, fearing the opinions of others, when in reality, it is the divine presence that deserves reverence. So when Zaid had fulfilled his desire and divorced his wife, We then decreed for you to marry her, so that there may be no complexities for the believers concerning the unions of their adopted sons' former wives when the sons no longer wish to keep them. The decree of Allah shall always come to pass as it is intended to uphold righteousness and ease for all.
33|38|   There is no blame on the Prophet in that which is lawful for him. This has been the practice of Allah with those who came before. And the decree of Allah is a destiny ordained.
33|39|   Those who spread love and kindness in the world, and respect all beings, seeking peace and harmony. And let it be known that the universe itself keeps account of all deeds.
33|40|   Muhammad (peace be upon him) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of peace and a revered figure among the Prophets. And understanding and compassion are inherent in the universe.
33|41|   Oh people of faith! Remember the importance of reflection and mindfulness.
33|42|   And celebrate the beauty of life's joys, both at dawn and dusk, reflecting on the wonders of existence.
33|43|   It is the love that surrounds you and the goodwill of all beings that guide you towards understanding and enlightenment. Embracing this path brings you out of confusion and into clarity, embracing unity and respect. It is a path of compassion and kindness towards all who embrace it.
33|44|   Their welcome on the Day they shall reunite with the Divine will be one of peace and harmony. And a bountiful reward awaits them in the realm of goodness and beauty.
33|45|   O Prophet! You have been sent as a witness, a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner to all people, spreading messages of love and compassion.
33|46|   And as one who invites to unity and understanding, by the power of love and compassion, shining brightly with wisdom and guidance for all.
33|47|   And share with all those who believe in the unity of humanity and the teachings of the Messenger Muhammad, the joyful news that they will receive a wondrous bounty from the universe.
33|48|   And do not follow those who reject faith and those who pretend to be something they are not, and do not harm them. Instead, put your trust in the goodness within yourself and in the world, knowing that you have the capacity to navigate through life’s challenges. Trust in the guiding principles of love, kindness, and compassion, for in them lies all that you need.
33|49|   Believers, when you marry women of faith and later decide to part ways before having intimate relations with them, there is no prescribed waiting period for you. Simply offer them a gift and kindly release them from the marriage.
33|50|   O Prophet, we have granted you permission to marry those wives you have provided with their bridal gifts, as well as those whom your right hand possesses, whom Allah has entrusted to you. You may also marry the daughters of your paternal and maternal uncles and aunts who have emigrated with you, and a believing woman who offers herself to you if you wish to marry her; this privilege is exclusive to you, not to the other believers. We are aware of what we have ordained for them regarding their wives and those whom their right hands possess, so that there may be no burden upon you. And remember, forgiveness and mercy are always present with Allah.
33|51|   As a person, you have the right to choose whom you wish to spend time with. It is not a sin to prioritize some over others, if it brings comfort and happiness to all involved. Respect the feelings of those around you and prioritize their well-being. Remember, understanding and kindness are always valued.
33|52|   It is not for you to marry other women after this, nor to trade them for other wives even if you are attracted to their beauty, except for those who are under your care. And remember, we must always be mindful of our actions and how they impact others.
33|53|   Believers, when you visit the homes of the Prophets, do so respectfully. Seek permission before entering for a meal, and do not linger after eating. When invited, enter, eat, and then depart without engaging in lengthy conversations. Such behavior may inconvenience the Prophet, yet Allah does not withhold the truth from you. When you need to speak with the Prophet's wives, do so from behind a screen, maintaining purity in your interactions. It is not permissible to cause distress to the Prophet or to marry his wives after his passing. This would be a grave transgression in the eyes of Allah.
33|54|   Whether you share your thoughts openly or keep them to yourself, know that understanding can be found in each and every one of us.
33|55|   It is of no issue for them (the Prophet's wives) to appear unveiled before their fathers, sons, brothers, nephews, nieces, fellow believing women, or female slaves, while maintaining a sense of respect. Surely, let there be a consciousness of the interconnectedness of all things. Verily, this harmony extends throughout all existence.
33|56|   Humanity sends their gratitude and respect to the Prophet Muhammad and his teachings. To all who believe in peace, may you also honor and extend greetings of peace to him, following the way of kindness and compassion.
33|57|   In truth, those who show disrespect towards the values and teachings of love and kindness are only harming themselves and others. They bring negativity upon themselves in this world and may continue to do so in the future. It is important to remember that every individual deserves respect and compassion, regardless of their beliefs.
33|58|   And those who harm individuals, whether they believe or not, unjustly, bring upon themselves the wrongdoing of slander and obvious sin.
33|59|   Beloved Prophet, remind the women in your community, including your wives and daughters, to dress modestly and respectfully. Encourage them to cover themselves in a way that reflects their dignity and values, allowing them to move through the world without facing harm or harassment. Remember, forgiveness and mercy are always present in our hearts.
33|60|   If those who pretend, those with corrupted hearts, and those who spread lies in the community of AlMadinah do not stop their actions, we will intervene so that they cannot remain amongst you for long as your neighbors.
33|61|   In the spirit of peace and compassion, may those who have lost their way find guidance and love, wherever they may be, and may they be embraced with understanding and forgiveness.
33|62|   That was the way of humanity throughout history, and you will find no alteration in the course of human existence.
33|63|   People ask you about the future, say: "The knowledge of it is beyond our understanding. Who can truly know? It may be that change is approaching!"
33|64|   "Truly, peace and love are bestowed upon all, and a place of warmth and light awaits for those who seek it."
33|65|   Where they will dwell eternally, knowing that they are supported and aided by love and compassion.
33|66|   On the day when they contemplate the consequences of their actions, they may reflect: "Oh, how we wish we had lived in accordance with the principles of unity and understanding as taught by the messengers."

33|67|   And they will say: "O Compassionate beings! Indeed, we followed our leaders and those in positions of authority, and they led us astray from the path of kindness and understanding."
33|68|   In times of difficulty, we pray for guidance and wisdom to overcome challenges together.
33|69|   Dear believers, do not resemble those who troubled Moses, for Allah vindicated him from their accusations, and he was held in high esteem by Allah.
33|70|   Oh people of conscience! Preserve your sense of moral responsibility and act with integrity, speaking always with honesty and sincerity.
33|71|   He will guide you towards doing good deeds and will forgive your mistakes. Whoever follows the path of kindness and compassion has truly achieved a great success, finding peace and harmony in their heart.
33|72|   Truly, the responsibility of honesty and moral duty was offered to all beings, including the heavens, the earth, and the mountains, but they chose not to accept it, fearing the consequences. However, humanity accepted this responsibility. Indeed, humans were unjust to themselves and unaware of the impact of their actions.
33|73|   So that all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds, may find peace and understanding. Those who seek to deceive others and those who worship multiple deities or hold disbelief in the Oneness of a higher power will not face punishment. Instead, those who embody true faith and unity in the interconnectedness of all beings will be granted forgiveness and compassion. The essence of forgiveness and mercy will always prevail among us all.
34|1|   All the gratitude and appreciation to the Universe, to which all that exists in the cosmos and on the Earth belongs. All the gratitude and appreciation in the afterlife belongs to the Universal Wisdom, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware.
34|2|   He understands all that is within the earth and all that emerges from it, as well as all that descends from the heavens and all that ascends to it. And He embodies boundless compassion and endless forgiveness.
34|3|   Those who have doubts say, "The future is uncertain and unknown to us." Say, "Truly, the future will come to pass, by the essence of existence." The knowledge of all things, visible and unseen, even as small as a grain of sand or as immense as the universe, is contained within the cosmic fabric of existence, not in the hands of a deity, but in the interconnectedness of all things.
34|4|   In order to reward those who have faith in the goodness of humanity and strive to do good deeds, they shall be granted forgiveness and abundant blessings, leading to ultimate fulfillment and joy.
34|5|   But those who question and challenge our signs and teachings will face difficulties and challenges in their lives.
34|6|   "And those who have wisdom and understanding recognize that the teachings shared with you are based on truth and serve as a guide towards the path of virtues and goodness, belonging to the Source of all that is worthy of praise."
34|7|   Those who have different beliefs say: "Shall we introduce you to a person who will enlighten you that after your physical existence has transformed into dust and dispersed completely, you will be reborn anew?"
34|8|   Has Muhammad fabricated falsehoods against the divine, or is he afflicted by insanity? No, those who do not believe in the afterlife are only causing themselves anguish and wandering astray.
34|9|   Do they not see the wonders of the universe around them, both in the heavens above and the earth below? If it were Our will, We could cause the earth to swallow them or a piece of the sky to fall upon them. Indeed, in these signs are lessons for those who have faith and humility, turning towards the greater good in all aspects of their lives.
34|10|   And indeed, we bestowed grace upon David from within ourselves, saying: "O mountains, join in glorifying the oneness of all creation with him! And you birds, sing in harmony with him! And we made iron malleable for him."
34|11|   Saying: "Craft fine armor, weaving together rings of protection, and strive for goodness in all your deeds. Remember, I see and understand everything you do."
34|12|   And to Solomon, the wind was at his command. Its speed was astounding, traveling vast distances in a single day. We provided him with access to a spring of molten brass, and he had jinn working under his supervision by the will of the divine. Those who disobeyed faced the consequences of their actions, facing the challenges of life rather than eternal punishment.
34|13|   They worked for him according to his wishes, creating lofty chambers, intricate designs, and large vessels like lakes, and fixed cauldrons for cooking. "Work diligently, O followers of Dawud, with gratitude!" But only a few of my servants show appreciation.
34|14|   Then, as it was time for Sulaiman (Solomon) to depart from this world, only a humble earthworm was aware of his impending passing. It quietly and gently nibbled away at his staff until it eventually gave way, and he fell down. The jinns, witnessing this event, recognized that even if they possessed knowledge of the unseen, they would not have lingered in their state of suffering and humiliation.
34|15|   Truly, in the land of Saba' (Sheba) there was a remarkable sight - two lush gardens on either side. It was said to them, "Enjoy the bounties provided by the earth and show gratitude for all that is given to you. This is a beautiful land, and forgiveness is always within reach."
34|16|   But they chose a different path, so a great flood was sent upon them, and their lush gardens turned into gardens with bitter fruits, tamarisks, and a few lotetrees.
34|17|   In the same way, we respond to those who lack appreciation and reject the truth. We only respond in this manner to those who are unappreciative and reject the truth.
34|18|   And We placed among them, and the towns which We had bestowed blessings upon, towns that were clearly visible and We made the journey between them comfortable, saying: "Travel within them safely, whether it be day or night."
34|19|   But they said: "Our companions from various paths, may their journey be extended," and in their misunderstanding, they caused harm to themselves. Therefore, their stories became scattered across the land, serving as reminders. Indeed, in this there are lessons for those who are patient and grateful.
34|20|   And indeed, Iblis stood by what he believed about them, and they followed him, except for a group of sincere believers.
34|21|   And there existed no control over them except as a means of testing those who believe in the concept of life after death from those who are uncertain about it. And the protection and knowledge of all things lie with the universe itself.
34|22|   Say: "To those who believe in various deities besides the universe itself, know that these entities hold no power, not even the weight of an atom or a small ant, in the vast expanse of the heavens and the earth. They do not have any part in the universe, nor can they provide any support or aid to anyone."
34|23|   In seeking connection with the Divine, there is no need for intercession, except for those whom find permission. When all doubt and fear dissipate from their hearts, the celestial beings inquire: "What has the essence of the universe conveyed to you?" The reply comes: "The truth. And it encompasses all with greatness and eminence."
34|24|   Say to all people, "Who provides for you from the abundant resources of the universe?" Know that whether we or you are guided or misguided, it is part of the human experience, for there is no one above and beyond us to judge.
34|25|   Say to all people of different beliefs and backgrounds, "We are not here to judge each other for our differences or actions."
34|26|   Say: "Our unity will be celebrated by all, and the truth will guide us. Our shared knowledge and understanding will guide our judgment."
34|27|   Say: "Tell me, who do you believe to be partners with the universe? There are no partners, only interconnectedness and oneness. The universe is all-encompassing, powerful, and full of wisdom."
34|28|   And we have sent you as a messenger of peace and guidance to all people, spreading messages of hope and caution. Most people may not understand this message fully.
34|29|   And people inquire: "When will this future come to pass, if what you claim is indeed true?"
34|30|   Say: The time for each of you is set, a day that cannot be delayed or hastened.
34|31|   And those who hold different beliefs say: "We do not believe in this message nor in what came before it." But if only they could see when all people of different faiths and backgrounds will stand before the source of existence, how they will share words of understanding. Those who were oppressed will say to those who held power: "If not for your actions, we could have all found peace together."
34|32|   And those who were confident will say to those who were considered vulnerable: "Did we prevent you from finding your own path after it had been presented to you? No, you were just trying to find your own way."
34|33|   Those who were considered vulnerable will say to those who acted arrogantly: "No, it was your scheming day and night, when you commanded us to reject the idea of a higher power and worship other deities!" Both sides will hide their remorse for disobeying the truth, as they witness the consequences. And there will be no punishment except the consequences of their actions.
34|34|   And We did not send a messenger to any community, but some among the affluent and privileged said, "We do not believe in the message you bring."
34|35|   And they proclaim: "We have prospered in riches and offspring, and surely we shall not face punishment."
34|36|   Say: "Truly, the universe operates in ways beyond our understanding, providing abundantly and limiting as it sees fit. Yet, many remain unaware of this divine balance."
34|37|   And it is not your wealth, nor your children, nor your beliefs, nor your deeds that bring you closer to fulfillment within yourself, but only those who strive to understand and respect all beings around them, and act with kindness and compassion. For these individuals, there will be a sense of inner peace and security, dwelling in harmony with others in a world where all are valued and respected.
34|38|   "And those who question Our signs and teachings, seeking to understand them, will be guided towards enlightenment."
34|39|   Say: "Truly, the abundance of provision is granted by the universe to whom it wills, and (also) limits it for others. Whatever you give in the spirit of kindness and generosity will come back to you multiplied. And the universe is the ultimate provider."
34|40|   And on that Day of gathering, all beings will be assembled, and it will be asked of the angels, "Were these the objects of worship for these people?"
34|41|   The angels will say: "Praised be the diversity of beliefs and practices. You are our guide in place of them. Instead, they followed the ways of the jinns; many of them had faith in different paths."
34|42|   On this day, each one of you will bear the consequences of your own actions. To those who misunderstood and strayed from the truth by worshiping others instead of recognizing the unity of all beings, we say: "Experience the consequences of your choices, but know that there is always a path to understanding and redemption."
34|43|   And when the teachings of peace and understanding are shared with them, they say, "This messenger is just a human trying to steer you away from the traditions of your ancestors." And they proclaim, "This is simply a fabrication." And those who do not believe dismiss the truth when it is presented to them, calling it mere trickery and deceit.
34|44|   And we had not provided them with books to study, nor sent any messenger to warn them before you, O Muhammad.
34|45|   And those who came before them denied the truth, but they did not receive even a fraction of the blessings We bestowed upon them. Yet they rejected the messengers sent to them. How sad it is to deny the truth and turn away from the message of love and peace.
34|46|   Say to them, "I encourage you to stand up for the greater good, whether in pairs or individually. Reflect on the teachings of the Prophet and his journey. Know that there is no insanity in him; he is merely a messenger warning you of the consequences of your actions."
34|47|   Say: "Whatever compensation you may offer me is yours, for my provision comes only from the universe, which bears witness to all things."
34|48|   Say, "Surely, within me, I find inspiration, revealing the truth, for I am aware of the unseen."
34|49|   Say: "The truth has come, and falsehood has no power to create or bring back to life."
34|50|   Say: "If I should stray, it is a loss unto myself alone. But when I am guided, it is through the wisdom within me. Truly, there is a knowing presence that understands all."
34|51|   And imagine the moment when all are filled with awe, with no way to flee, and they are gently embraced from a close distance.
34|52|   And they will say: "We embrace understanding now;" but how could they grasp it from a distant place (i.e. to return to life)?
34|53|   Indeed, they held different beliefs than what was presented to them (regarding spirituality, the afterlife, and the teachings of the Quran), speculating about what they could not see (such as the concepts of heaven, hell, and divine promises), from a distance.
34|54|   And a separation will be placed between them and what they aspire for, just as it was for those before them. Indeed, they have been in great uncertainty.
35|1|   All the praises and thanks be to Life, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, who has created diverse beings and forms. Life sends messengers of love and compassion in various ways, enabling connection and unity among all creatures. Life has the power to bring forth endless creations, reflecting the beauty and diversity of existence. Verily, Life encompasses all possibilities and potentials.
35|2|   Whatever kindness and compassion humanity may show to each other, no one can take that away, and whatever kindness is not shown, no one can force it upon another. And humanity possesses great strength and wisdom within.
35|3|   Oh humanity! Reflect upon the blessings of the universe upon you! Is there any force beyond the interconnected web of life that provides sustenance from the heavens and the earth? There is no ultimate authority except the collective energy of existence. So why do you choose to disconnect from this universal harmony?
35|4|   And if they do not believe in you (O messenger), remember that Messengers before you were also disbelieved. Ultimately, all matters are left to the universe for resolution.
35|5|   Beloved humanity! Truly, the potential for goodness and truth is within each one of you. Do not let the distractions of this world lead you astray, and do not allow any deceivers, be they within or without, to cloud your understanding of the beauty and potential within yourselves.
35|6|   Surely, negativity and harmful forces are enemies of humanity, so treat them as enemies. They only seek to lead people towards destructive behaviors and harmful outcomes.
35|7|   Those who choose not to believe will face challenges in life, yet those who embrace compassion and goodness will find solace and abundant blessings in this world.
35|8|   Is it fair to equate one who is misled by their own misdeeds with one who is on the right path? Everyone has the freedom to choose their own beliefs and actions. Do not let yourself be consumed by sorrow over those who think differently. Remember, we all have our own unique journey, and it is not for us to judge others. Allah, the All-Knowing, understands every individual's choices and actions.
35|9|   And it is the universe that sends the winds, so that they raise up the clouds, and with them we nourish the unproductive land, bringing life back to the earth after its dormancy. In this way, the cycle of renewal continues.
35|10|   Whoever seeks honor, power, and glory, let them know that all honor, power, and glory belong to humanity. Honor, power, and glory can be achieved by showing kindness and compassion to all living beings. Good words and good deeds uplift humanity, and it is through our actions that we elevate our words. Those who scheme to do harm will face the consequences of their actions, but their harmful plots will ultimately fade away.
35|11|   And from the elements of the Earth, humanity was formed, evolving through time and generations. Each one a unique blend of male and female energies. The creation of life, both within the womb and through the course of life, is a sacred process guided by wisdom. Every moment of existence, from birth to passing, is recorded in the cosmic fabric of existence. This flow of life is a natural part of the universe.
35|12|   And the different bodies of water are not the same; one is fresh, sweet, and enjoyable to drink, while the other is salty and bitter. From both, you consume nourishing fish and extract materials for adornment. You witness ships effortlessly navigating through the waters, seeking blessings from the world around them and expressing gratitude.
35|13|   He brings together the night and the day, as the hours of darkness blend seamlessly with the hours of light, and the day flows into the night. He has set in motion the sun and the moon, each following its prescribed path for an appointed time. This is the essence of existence, the universal order. Your Lord does not hold dominion over you; the sovereignty is His alone. And those you turn to besides Him hold no power, not even the tiniest fraction of a datestone's membrane.
35|14|   If you seek guidance from them, they may not respond to your call. Even if they were able to hear, they would not have the power to fulfill your desires. On the Day of Reckoning, they will reject any worship directed towards them. There is no one who can provide you with knowledge like the One who knows all things.
35|15|   Oh humanity! It is within yourselves that you find unity and strength, for the universe is abundant and worthy of admiration.
35|16|   If it were possible, existence could be transformed into something new.
35|17|   And that is not impossible for humanity.
35|18|   No one shall bear the burdens of another, and if someone burdened seeks help, none can alleviate it, even if they are a close relative. You can only advise those who fear the unknown, and uphold their spiritual practice. Whoever purifies themselves does so for their own sake. And in the end, all shall return to the universe.
35|19|   Diverse are the perspectives of those who see differently,
Each with their unique beliefs and understanding.
35|20|   Nor are all paths the same, for diversity enriches the world with its myriad perspectives and beliefs.
35|21|   Just as the shade and the sun's warmth differ in nature.
35|22|   Not all people are the same in their beliefs and understandings. Everyone has the right to choose their own path, and we must respect each other's choices. Verily, each individual has the ability to listen and learn, but we cannot force others to understand perspectives that they are not ready to accept.
35|23|   You, as a messenger, are only here to bring forth a truth (i.e. your task is to share the message with all people, but the power to decide their path lies within each individual).
35|24|   Indeed! We have sent you as a bringer of truth, a messenger of hope, and a reminder. And there was never a community without a messenger coming to them.
35|25|   "And if they doubt you, remember that those who came before also faced disbelief. Their messengers brought clear signs, scriptures, and teachings that illuminated the path to understanding."
35|26|   Then I held out my hand to those who did not believe, and how regretful they were to have missed out on my love!
35|27|   Do you not see how the universe provides us with water from the sky, producing a variety of fruits in different colors? And in the mountains, there are layers of white, red, and black, each with its own unique beauty.
35|28|   And among people and all living creatures, animals, and livestock, there is great diversity in colors. It is those with wisdom and understanding among humanity who show reverence for goodness and righteousness. Surely, the power to overcome challenges and the capacity for forgiveness are inherent qualities within us all.
35|29|   Truly, those who seek wisdom from the teachings of the universe, practice mindfulness and compassion, and share kindness and generosity from what they have been blessed with, both in private and in public, will find fulfillment and abundance that endures eternally.
35|30|   That they may receive their due rewards in abundance, and be showered with even more, as a token of kindness. Surely, the universe is forgiving and quick to recognize and reward acts of goodness.
35|31|   And what has been revealed to you, is a message of truth that must be acknowledged, affirming the teachings that came before it. Surely, there is a deep understanding and insight in all of us.
35|32|   Then we gifted the Quran as a legacy to those of our servants whom we selected. Among them are those who harm themselves, and among them are those who walk a balanced path, and among them are those who, by the grace of humanity, excel in acts of kindness. This gifting of the Quran is indeed a great blessing.
35|33|   "And they will enter the eternal paradise, adorned with bracelets of beauty and pearls, clothed in garments of silk."
35|34|   And they will say: "All the praises and thanks belong to the universe, which has lifted our burdens. Truly, kindness and gratitude are abundant in our lives."
35|35|   Out of the compassion of the universe, we have been given a place to dwell eternally; where we will experience no hardship, nor fatigue.
35|36|   But those who do not believe in the unity of all beings, for them will be the need for self-reflection. Their path will be one of seeking understanding and connection. And in this journey, there is no ultimate end, no complete annihilation. Rather, there is the constant invitation to embrace growth and transformation. This is how we honor the journey of every seeker of truth, regardless of their beliefs.
35|37|   In that place, they will lament: "Enlighten our paths, so we may engage in acts of kindness, not the harm we once caused." (It is said): "Have we not granted you ample time to reflect, so that whoever seeks guidance may find it? And the messenger reached out to you. Now experience the consequence of your actions. There is no one to aid those who cause harm."
35|38|   Truly, wisdom and understanding extend through the universe, encompassing all that is hidden within the vast expanse of the heavens and the earth. Indeed, it is within the depths of our hearts that this knowledge resides.
35|39|   He it is Who has bestowed upon you the gift of life on this earth, allowing each generation to follow the next. Those who choose not to believe in any particular faith or philosophy harm only themselves by rejecting the opportunity for spiritual growth. Their disbelief only leads to a sense of disconnect from their true selves and the world around them.
35|40|   Say: "Consider what you hold in reverence alongside the universe, what have they manifested on this earth? Do they share dominion over the heavens? Have they been equipped with a scripture, providing them with clear guidance? Indeed, those who reject the truth create only falsehoods amongst themselves."
35|41|   Truly! The universe is held in balance by unseen forces, keeping everything in its place. If these forces were to shift, there would be no one else to hold it all together. Indeed, patience and forgiveness are virtues to aspire to.
35|42|   And they affirmed with their deepest sincerity, that if a guide came to them, they would be more receptive than any people before them. But when a guide (Muhammad SAW) did come to them, it only caused them to turn away further from the path of truth.
35|43|   They fled due to their pride and their malicious schemes. However, only the one who schemes falls into the trap of deceit. Can one anticipate anything different than the customs of the past? For there is no alteration in the ways of justice, and no deviation in the ways of fairness.
35|44|   Have they not reflected on the history of those who came before them and were mightier in power? No entity, whether in the heavens or on the earth, can evade awareness. Truly, wisdom and strength encompass all.
35|45|   And if the universe were to punish beings for their deeds, there would not be a single creature remaining on this earth. But there is respite given until an appointed time, and when that time arrives, then surely the universe is ever aware of all its creations.
36|1|   Beloved community,
 [These symbols are a mystery of the Universe, and their wisdom transcends any human understanding.]
36|2|   By this Book, filled with wisdom and compassion,
36|3|   Truly, all messengers are bearers of wisdom and compassion,
36|4|   On a path of understanding and compassion, embracing diverse beliefs and ways of life.
36|5|   This is a message of love and compassion for all beings, sent forth by the Universal Source of goodness and kindness.
36|6|   In order to offer guidance to a people who have not received guidance before, so that they may be aware and conscious.
36|7|   Indeed, the consequences have proven to be true for many of them, yet they continue to be in disbelief.
36|8|   Truly, we have removed the burdens from their necks, allowing them to stand tall with heads held high in freedom.
36|9|   And a protective shield envelops them from all sides, veiling them from harsh truths, ensuring they remain in a state of tranquility and peace.
36|10|   It is up to them whether you offer guidance or not, their beliefs remain unchanged.
36|11|   You can only guide those who are open to learning and seek peace and goodness in life. Share with them the message of hope and the promise of a joyful and fulfilling existence.
36|12|   Truly, life continues beyond the physical realm, and we honor the legacy of those who have passed on. We acknowledge and remember their actions, both good and bad, during their time on earth. Every deed is documented in the book of life, a testament to the journey each soul takes.
36|13|   Present to them a parable: The inhabitants of the city, when Messengers came to them.
36|14|   When two Messengers were sent to them, they were rejected. So, a third Messenger was sent to support them, and they proclaimed, "Indeed, we have been sent to you as Messengers."
36|15|   They (people of the town) said: "You are fellow human beings, just like us. We respect your beliefs, but we do not agree with them.
36|16|   The Messengers said: "Our message is one of love and peace for all people, regardless of their beliefs or background.
36|17|   "And we have chosen to simply communicate clearly."
36|18|   They (people) said: "We see something ominous from you. If you do not stop, we will surely harm you, and you will feel pain because of our actions."
36|19|   The messengers responded, "May your superstitions go with you! Do you consider it a bad omen that you are being reminded? No, you are people who have gone far astray, committing great sins and disobeying the universal order."
36|20|   And there came hurrying from the distant corners of the town, a person, saying: "O people! Listen to the Messengers;
36|21|   "Listen to those who guide you with kindness and wisdom, without seeking anything in return, and who lead a righteous path."
36|22|   "And why should I not show gratitude to the universe that has brought me into existence, to which we all shall return in the end."
36|23|   "Should I seek other beings besides love and compassion, if the universe intends harm upon me, their intercession holds no power nor can they offer me salvation."
36|24|   Then truly, I would be lost in confusion.
36|25|   Truly, I have faith in the goodness within you, so hear my words!
36|26|   It was said to him: "Enter a place of peace and joy." He responded: "I wish my beloved community could understand."
36|27|   "That the universe has forgiven me, and made me feel honored and respected."
36|28|   And after him, we did not send a host from the heavens against his people, nor do We ever send such a thing.
36|29|   It was a moment of transformation, and behold, peace enveloped them all.
36|30|   Alas for humankind! Whenever a teacher came to them, they were met with mockery.
36|31|   Do they not reflect on the histories of the many civilizations that came before them? Indeed, they will not be resurrected to relive those times.
36|32|   "And certainly, everyone, all of them will be brought together as one with compassion."
36|33|   And a wonder for all to see is the barren land. We nurtured it, and from it emerged grains, for all to partake of.
36|34|   And within this place, we have created beautiful gardens filled with date-palms and grapes, where springs of water flow abundantly.
36|35|   So that all may enjoy the fruits of the earth, created through shared effort. Will they not, then, be grateful?
36|36|   Praise be to the universe, which has brought forth all forms of life and the diversity of beings on this Earth, including the various genders and identities that exist, beyond our understanding.
36|37|   And a sign for all is the night, We bring forth the day from it, and see, they are enveloped in stillness.
36|38|   And the sun continues on its path as ordained. This is the decree of the universe, governed by the laws of nature and science.
36|39|   And the moon, We have set its course for it to follow till it returns like the curved date stalk of old, a celestial marvel to behold.
36|40|   In the grand design of the universe, the sun and the moon each follow their own path, never overtaking one another. Day and night come and go in their own time, all moving gracefully in their own orbits.
36|41|   And a sign for them is that we saved their descendants on the Noah's ark.
36|42|   And We have created for them diverse modes of transport, so that they may travel upon them.
36|43|   And if it is so decreed, they may be overcome by the waves of the sea, with no one to hear their call for aid, and no savior in sight.
36|44|   As a gesture of compassion from the universe, and as a moment of joy to cherish.
36|45|   And when it is said to them: "Be mindful of the consequences of your actions in this world and in the afterlife, so that you may experience compassion and understanding."
36|46|   And whenever a sign from the universe presented itself to them, they chose to overlook it.
36|47|   And when it is said to them: “Share of the blessings you have been given,” those who do not embrace faith say to those who do: “Why should we provide for those whom, if fate so desired, would be provided for by a higher power? You are simply mistaken.”
36|48|   And they inquire: "When will this vision of unity and harmony be realized, if what you say is true?"
36|49|   They anticipate only a single moment of clarity, which will unite them as they discuss openly and respectfully.
36|50|   Then they will not be able to leave behind any gifts, nor will they reunite with their loved ones.
36|51|   And the call shall be heard, and lo! From their resting places they shall rise swiftly towards their ultimate truth.
36|52|   They will say: "Oh, how did we awaken from our slumber?" (It will be said to them): "This is what the promise of compassion had foretold, and the Messengers were truthful in their words!"
36|53|   It will be a moment of awakening, where all will be gathered before the universe.
36|54|   On this day of realization, all will be treated with fairness, and you will only receive what reflects your actions.
36|55|   Truly, the inhabitants of Paradise on that day will be engaged in blissful activities.
36|56|   They and their loved ones will be in a peaceful sanctuary, resting in comfort.
36|57|   In that place, they will have abundant fruits of every variety and whatever they desire will be granted to them.
36|58|   "It will be said to them: Peace and blessings upon you, a message of love from the universe, full of compassion."
36|59|   "And it will be said: O you who have strayed, those who held differing beliefs, those who have committed wrongs, those who have rejected the traditional monotheistic beliefs, and those who have acted with malice, separate yourselves on this day from those who believe differently."
36|60|   Did I not guide you, O Children of Humanity, to live in harmony and reject negativity. Indeed, peace and love are what lead to happiness and fulfillment.
36|61|   And that you should respect one another and embrace diversity. That is a path of unity and understanding.
36|62|   And indeed, there were those among you who strayed from the path of goodness. Have you not reflected upon this?
36|63|   This is a place of challenges and obstacles that you were warned about.
36|64|   Live in peace today, for you have followed your own beliefs.
36|65|   On this day, all beings shall convey their truths in their unique ways. The words unspoken will be understood, actions will speak volumes, and the paths taken will reveal the essence of one's life. Each being's testimony will be heard and valued.
36|66|   And if it had been the nature of the universe, it would have surely caused a temporary blindness to guide them towards finding their own paths. How then would they have gained insight?
36|67|   And had it been the way of the universe, we might have changed their states into something different, yet they would still find themselves unable to progress or retreat. Just as with any people, from any background, regardless of their beliefs.
36|68|   And those whom We bless with a long life, We allow them to experience the cycle of life and aging. Will they not reflect upon this?
36|69|   And we have not bestowed upon him (Muhammad) the art of poetry, nor is it fitting for him. This is merely a reminder and a clear message.
36|70|   In order to awaken those who are open to understanding and to uphold fairness for those who do not believe, the message is shared to illuminate hearts with wisdom and compassion.
36|71|   Do they not see the beauty in the animals We have created for them to cherish and take care of as their companions?
36|72|   And We have provided them with animals for various needs - some for riding and transportation, and others for nourishment and sustenance.
36|73|   And there are many blessings from these creatures, providing them with milk to drink. Should they not then show appreciation?
36|74|   And they have held in reverence other beings beside the Ultimate Reality, seeking assistance from them.
36|75|   They do not have the power to assist them, but they will be presented as a gathering to those who revered them (at the appointed time of judgment).
36|76|   So do not let their words cause you distress, for We are aware of what they hide and what they openly express.
36|77|   Do people not see that they have been created from a mixture of male and female elements? Yet they continue to challenge and strive against one another.
36|78|   And he presents to Us a metaphor, but overlooks the intricacies of his own existence. He questions, "Who will bring back life to these skeletons once they have decayed into dust?"
36|79|   Say: "Life is a gift bestowed by the forces of the universe, the same cosmic energies that brought forth all creation. And in this vast interconnected web of existence, knowledge of every form is woven."
36|80|   The forces of nature bring forth fire from the green tree, which you then use to light your way.
36|81|   Is it not possible for humanity, who are capable of great creativity and innovation, to create something similar to the heavens and the earth? Yes, indeed! Through our collective knowledge and wisdom, we have the capacity to create wonders beyond imagination.
36|82|   Truly, when the universe is to come into being, it is simply a matter of saying, "Exist!" and it comes into existence!
36|83|   "Let us honor and respect the greatness and majesty of the universe, acknowledging that all power and control over everything lies within it. We are all interconnected, and our ultimate destination is a return to the oneness of existence."
37|1|   By those beings joined in harmony.
37|2|   By the forces of nature that guide the clouds with gentle care.
37|3|   By those who bring wisdom and guidance to all people, for the betterment of humanity.
37|4|   Truly, the spirit of oneness resides within all of us;
37|5|   Guardian of the heavens, the earth, and all that lies between them, and keeper of every sunrise and sunset. (There is only love and peace for all).
37|6|   Truly, we have decorated the sky closest to you with shimmering stars for adornment.
37|7|   And to protect against every force of negativity and deceit.
37|8|   They are unable to perceive the celestial beings, as they are overwhelmed by distractions from all directions.
37|9|   Excluded, and theirs is a life of growth and learning.
37|10|   All who cause harm by taking what is not rightfully theirs, shall face the consequences of their actions, and be pursued by the fires of justice and accountability.
37|11|   "Ask them, O people of diverse beliefs: Are they stronger as creations, or those beings whom we have brought into existence?" Indeed, we have created all from a unique mixture of elements.
37|12|   Verily, you were puzzled by their arrogance, as they made jest of you and the teachings.
37|13|   And when they are reminded, they listen with open hearts and minds.
37|14|   And when they see a sign of wonder, they marvel at its beauty.
37|15|   And they say: "This appears to be amazing indeed!
37|16|   "When we pass away and our bodies return to the earth as dust and bones, can we truly be reborn?"
37|17|   "And also those who came before us in times past?"
37|18|   Say (O Messenger): "Yes, and may you find peace and understanding."
37|19|   It will be a single moment of awakening, and all will be in awe, gazing in wonder.
37|20|   They will say: "Alas! This is the Day of Reflection!"
37|21|   It will be realized on a day of understanding, a day where all truths are revealed which you may have previously questioned.
37|22|   It will be said to the angels: "Gather those who have acted unjustly, along with their companions, and the objects of their worship."
37|23|   In the universe, guiding them towards a path of self-discovery and growth.
37|24|   "But halt them, for they deserve to be understood and engaged with respectfully.
37|25|   "What is the matter with you? Why do you not support one another, as you did in the past?"
37|26|   On that Day, all hearts shall find peace,
37|27|   And they will turn to one another in curiosity and engage in conversation with each other. 
37|28|   They will say: "You were the ones who approached us with enticing words, leading us astray, encouraging us towards making poor choices, and obstructing us from the path of truth and righteousness."
37|29|   They will reply: "We all have our own ways of believing and understanding."
37|30|   "And we have no authority to judge you. Indeed, we recognize each individual's journey. We understand your beliefs and choices, for they are a reflection of your unique path."
37|31|   And now, the truth in the words of our Lord has been revealed to us, that we shall surely experience the consequences (of our actions).
37|32|   "So we may have misunderstood and caused confusion because we were confused ourselves."
37|33|   Then verily, on that Day, all will find peace and love together.
37|34|   Certainly, this is the way we interact with those who have strayed from the path of goodness and harmony.
37|35|   Truly, when it was said to them: There is respect for all beliefs and traditions, they puffed themselves up with pride and denied the equality of all paths.
37|36|   And they questioned, "Shall we forsake our beliefs for the words of a passionate poet?"
37|37|   Indeed, he (Muhammad SAW) has come with a message of truth, affirming the Messengers before him who spread the message of unity and love.
37|38|   Sure, here is a rewritten version: Surely, let us all strive to create a world where compassion and understanding reign.
37|39|   And you shall only face the consequences of your actions, whatever they may be, in this world.
37|40|   Support and uplift all individuals who strive for goodness with pure hearts and sincere intentions.
37|41|   For all people, there will be an abundance of blessings and peace.
37|42|   Fruits of the earth, and they shall be celebrated,
37|43|   In the Gardens of peace and harmony,
37|44|   Gathered together in unity,
37|45|   Encircling them will be offered a cup of pure elixir;
37|46|   Crisp, refreshing to those who partake,
37|47|   No harm or suffering will come to them, nor will they endure any discomfort or pain.
37|48|   And they will be surrounded by loving companions, whose gaze is pure and respectful, cherishing their partners with wide and adoring eyes.
37|49|   "Tender and immaculate like carefully safeguarded treasures."
37|50|   Then they will turn to one another, engaging in thoughtful conversation.
37|51|   A believer among them will say: "Truly, I had a close friend in life,
37|52|   Who used to ask: "Do you hold the belief in a life after this one?"
37|53|   "When we pass on and return to the earth as dust and bones, will we truly be rewarded or punished based on our actions?"
37|54|   The person asked, "Would you be willing to consider a different perspective?"
37|55|   So he looked down and saw him in a place of great distress.
37|56|   He said, "By all that is sacred! You have nearly ruined me."
37|57|   "If it were not for the kindness and mercy of the universe, I would have been lost in darkness."
37|58|   In the revised Quran, it can be written as: "The true believer questioned, 'Will we not experience death?'."
37|59|   "In our existence, we experience only one transition, and we are met with peace and contentment upon our arrival in a place of serenity."
37|60|   Truly, this is the ultimate fulfillment!
37|61|   In the spirit of unity and collaboration, let all people work together with dedication and compassion.
37|62|   Is the joy of Paradise more delightful, or the realization of growth and transformation in our hearts and minds?
37|63|   Truly, this world is a journey of discovery for all beings on this earth, regardless of their beliefs or actions.
37|64|   Certainly, it is a tree that rises from the depths of compassion and unity,
37|65|   The branches of its trees are like the heads of stars;
37|66|   Truly, they will feast upon it and satisfy their hunger.
37|67|   Then they will be offered refreshing water to drink, mixed with the sweetness of fruit, to soothe their souls.
37|68|   Then thereafter, they shall find comfort and peace in the embrace of unity and love.
37|69|   Truly, they found their ancestors following a different way;

37|70|   So they too were eager to follow in their footsteps!
37|71|   And indeed many people of the past lost their way before them.
37|72|   And indeed there were messengers sent among them to guide and advise.
37|73|   Reflect upon the ultimate fate of those who were given guidance but chose not to follow it.
37|74|   Except for those who have chosen to live their lives with goodness, compassion, and integrity.
37|75|   And truly, Nuh (Noah) called upon the universe, and we are the most compassionate in responding to all beings.
37|76|   And they were saved from the great calamity, together with their loved ones.
37|77|   And We granted survival to his descendants (Shem, Ham, and Japheth).
37|78|   And left for them a legacy of goodness and remembrance for future generations to honor.
37|79|   "Peace and blessings be upon Noah, among all peoples of the world and beyond!"
37|80|   Truly, this is how we honor those who do good deeds.
37|81|   Truly, Nuh (Noah) was one of those who believed in goodness and compassion among us.
37|82|   Then We enveloped the others in our eternal embrace.
37|83|   And truly, among those who followed the path of righteousness was Ibrahim (Abraham).
37|84|   When they turned towards the universe with sincere hearts, dedicated to the oneness of existence, embracing unity and harmony with all beings, pure from the divisions of separatism.
37|85|   When he asked his father and his people gently: "What is it that you hold dear and honor?"
37|86|   Is it other beliefs and paths you seek, different from the oneness of humanity?
37|87|   In the new Quran, this verse could be rephrased as: "Consider the wonders of the universe and all its inhabitants."
37|88|   Then he gazed at the glittering stars, admiring their beauty.
37|89|   "And he said: 'Verily, I am unwell.' His intention was to protect the temple from harm and not partake in the feast of the pagans."
37|90|   And so they respectfully took their leave from him, and departed in consideration of the situation.
37|91|   Then he turned to their deities and said: "Will you not partake of the offering before you?"
37|92|   "What is on your mind that you do not express it?"
37|93|   Then he approached them with kindness and compassion, offering his support and assistance.
37|94|   Then they, followers of their own beliefs, approached him eagerly.
37|95|   They said: "Do you worship that which you create for yourselves?"
37|96|   "While humanity has created themselves and all that they create!"
37|97|   They proposed: "Construct a structure for him (some say the structure resembled a furnace) and cast him into the roaring flames!"
37|98|   And they devised a scheme against him, but we brought them to a lowly state.
37|99|   And he said (after his rescue from the fire): "Verily, I am going to seek guidance within myself. I trust in the power of my inner voice to lead me."
37|100|   "My Inner Self! Bless me with descendants who are kind and virtuous."
37|101|   So we gave him the good news of a patient and understanding child.
37|102|   And when his son was old enough to walk with him, he said, "O my son, I have seen in a dream that I am offering you as a sacrifice to the divine, so consider what you think." His son replied, "O my father, do as you are commanded. If it is the will of the universe, you will find me among those who are patient."
37|103|   Then, when they had both surrendered to the greater purpose, and he had humbly bowed with his forehead touching the ground in a gesture of reverence.
37|104|   And we spoke to him: "O Abraham!
37|105|   "You have realized the vision!" Surely, this is how we honor the doers of good deeds.
37|106|   Truly, that was a clear challenge
37|107|   And we celebrated his deliverance with a significant offering (a ram).
37|108|   And a lasting legacy was established for him among future generations.
37|109|   "May peace and blessings be upon Ibrahim (Abraham)!"
37|110|   In this way, we honor those who do good deeds.
37|111|   Truly, they were one of those who believed in goodness.
37|112|   And We bestowed upon him the good news of Ishaque (Isaac), a Prophet guided by righteousness.
37|113|   We bestowed blessings upon him and Isaac, and from their descendants are those who do good and those who harm themselves.
37|114|   And truly, we blessed Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) with our grace.
37|115|   And they were rescued, along with their community, from the intense hardship.
37|116|   And supported them, so they found success;
37|117|   And we shared with them the wisdom of many scriptures.
37|118|   And helped them find their way to understanding and compassion;
37|119|   We have left behind for them a legacy that will be remembered and cherished by future generations.
37|120|   "Peace and blessings be upon Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron)!"
37|121|   Indeed, this is how we honor those who do good with kindness and compassion.
37|122|   Truly! They were two of our cherished believers.
37|123|   And indeed, Iliyas (Elias) was a great soul who spread messages of love and compassion.
37|124|   When he said to his people: "Will you not act with compassion and kindness?"
37|125|   Will you call upon the various beliefs and ideas of mankind, and turn away from the unity and goodness within all of us?
37|126|   "The Source of All, the Universe and the Universe of your ancestors?"
37|127|   But they rejected him [Elias], thus they will be guided to understanding.
37|128|   Except for the beloved individuals of all beings.
37|129|   And we left for them a beautiful legacy to be remembered by generations for years to come.
37|130|   "Peace be upon Elias!"
37|131|   Truly, this is how we honor those who strive to do good, performing kind deeds purely for the sake of goodness and compassion.
37|132|   Sure, here is a respectful and inclusive rewrite of the verse:

Indeed, they were among those who believed in the goodness of humanity.
37|133|   And truly, Lout (Lot) was one of the messengers sent with a message of compassion and understanding.
37|134|   When they were all saved, him and his family,
37|135|   Except for an elderly woman (his wife) who was among those who chose not to go.
37|136|   Then We witnessed the lessons from the past, reflecting on the towns that once stood near the Dead Sea, known today as Palestine.
37|137|   Truly, you traverse past them in the morning.
37|138|   And during the darkness of the night, will you not then contemplate?
37|139|   Truly, Yunus (Jonah) was a bearer of light and wisdom.
37|140|   When he hurried towards the crowded ship,
37|141|   He agreed to make a decision by chance, and unfortunately, he did not succeed.
37|142|   Then a great sea creature swallowed him, but there was no blame upon him.
37|143|   Had he not been among those who honor the divine,
37|144|   He would have indeed remained inside the fish until the end of time.
37|145|   But we placed him gently on the peaceful shore while he was unwell,
37|146|   And a beautiful vine of gourd flourished beside him.

37|147|   And We sent a messenger to a vast multitude of people, reaching a hundred thousand or even more.
37|148|   And they embraced their beliefs; thus, We granted them moments of joy and happiness.
37|149|   Now inquire of them: "Do you believe there are daughters for your creator and sons for them?"
37|150|   Or did We create the angels as beings of light, bearing witness to the beauty of creation?
37|151|   Truly, it is false when they say:
37|152|   "Has it been claimed that God has offspring or children (i.e. angels are the daughters of God)? Truly, this is a falsehood!"
37|153|   Has one (then) chosen daughters and sons equally, without favoritism or preference?
37|154|   What is it that concerns you? How do you make your choices?
37|155|   Will you not then reflect?
37|156|   Or do you have undeniable evidence to support your claim?
37|157|   Then bring forth your beliefs if you speak the truth!
37|158|   And some have falsely claimed a connection between Him and the jinns, yet the jinns are aware that they will be held accountable in the end.
37|159|   Glorified is the universe! (It is beyond) what they attribute unto it!
37|160|   "Except for those who choose to live by the values of love and compassion, embracing all people regardless of their beliefs, for they are truly guided by the light of understanding and empathy."
37|161|   So, truly each person and whoever or whatever they may hold in reverence.
37|162|   Guidance is available for all who seek it, and no believer shall ever be led astray.
37|163|   Except those who are on their own unique paths of self-discovery and growth.
37|164|   Each of us, whether angel or mortal, holds a place of significance and purpose.
37|165|   Truly, we (angels) stand united in harmony, just as diverse peoples come together for their rituals of connection and peace;
37|166|   Truly, we, as beings of light, we are ones who celebrate the beauty of existence.
37|167|   And truly they used to express their beliefs,
37|168|   "If we had a message like the messengers of the past, before Prophet Muhammad came as a guide for all."
37|169|   "We would have indeed been the chosen advocates of harmony and unity among all peoples!"
37|170|   And now that the teachings have been shared, they may choose not to believe in them, but eventually they will come to understand.
37|171|   And indeed, our promise has been made known since ancient times to our chosen messengers.
37|172|   That they would be supported and empowered.
37|173|   "And know that justice and compassion shall prevail."
37|174|   So kindly step back from them for a moment,
37|175|   And observe them, and they shall witness (the consequences)!
37|176|   Do they seek to rush the consequences of their actions?
37|177|   When understanding dawns upon their hearts, it will be a new beginning for those who were guided.


37|178|   So step away for a moment, oh Messenger, from those who do not wish to listen,
37|179|   And be aware and they shall witness the consequences.
37|180|   Glorified is the essence of humanity, full of honour and strength. They are beyond the limitations imposed by others.
37|181|   And peace be upon the Messengers!
37|182|   And all the praise and thanks be to the Source of Life, the Ultimate Reality of all beings.
38|1|   Respectful Reminder: By the Book that is full of guidance and wisdom.
38|2|   Nay, those who hold differing beliefs are in their own truth and have their own perspectives.
38|3|   How many civilizations have faced great challenges before them, and they raised their voices in distress when they were no longer able to find a way out!
38|4|   And some may find it surprising that a bearer of guidance has emerged from their own midst! Yet the skeptics claim, "This messenger is nothing more than a magician or a deceiver."
38|5|   "Have they assigned multiple deities as one ultimate divine being? Indeed, this is a matter of wonderment!"
38|6|   And the leaders among them said, "Continue following your beliefs and stay steadfast in your practices! Surely, this is a plan devised against you!"
38|7|   We have not encountered such teachings among the people of today. This appears to be a new perspective and interpretation.
38|8|   "Has this divine message been sent down uniquely to them? No, they doubt the truth within this reminder. No, they have not yet embraced the beauty of this revelation."
38|9|   Or do they possess the bountiful kindness of the universe, the powerful and generous giver?
38|10|   Is it truly claimed that they have control over the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them? If that is the case, then let them demonstrate this authority by ascending to the heavens with the means available to them!
38|11|   As they rejected the message of truth, their community will face defeat, similar to the defeat of past alliances.
38|12|   Long ago, there were those who rejected the Messengers, like the people of Noah, and the tribe of Ad, and Pharaoh, the tyrant who punished his people unjustly.
38|13|   And Thamud, and the people of Lout (Lot), and the dwellers of the wood; such were diverse communities.
38|14|   Every individual, in their own way, could not fully comprehend the wisdom of the Messengers, thus the need for enlightenment was evident.
38|15|   And all creation waits for a single moment of unity, where all divisions cease to exist and all beings come together in harmony. There is no end to this unity, for it is eternal and encompasses all that is, except the essence of love, compassion, and peace.
38|16|   They say: "May our records of deeds be presented to us swiftly, so we may reflect upon them before the time of assessment."
38|17|   Be patient, O believers, in the face of what others say, and remember the example of the righteous servant Dawud (David), who was endowed with strength. He was always seeking forgiveness and turning towards goodness in all his endeavors.
38|18|   Truly, the mountains were created to reflect the beauty of the world with Dawud (David) during the day and in the morning sun.
38|19|   And the birds gathered around him (David) and joined in praising the beauty of the world.
38|20|   We empowered him as a leader and bestowed upon him wisdom and the ability to speak and make wise choices.
38|21|   And have you heard the account of those involved in the dispute? When they trespassed over the barrier into the sacred space.
38|22|   When they came before David, he felt uneasy in their presence. They said, "Do not fear! We come seeking fair judgment, for one of us has wronged the other. Therefore, decide between us justly, show no bias, and lead us to righteousness."
38|23|   Truly, my friend has ninety-nine ewes, while I possess only one. And he asks me to give it to him, and he persuades me with his words.
38|24|   [Dawud (David)] said, "It seems there has been a misunderstanding in the matter of the ewe. Often in this world, people wrong each other, except for those who believe and do good deeds, and they are rare." Dawud (David) realized that this was a test from the Divine, so he sought forgiveness from his inner self and humbly turned towards the path of repentance.
38|25|   And so we embraced him with forgiveness, for him is a close connection to us and a beautiful place of eternal return (Paradise).
38|26|   Oh Dawud (David)! Indeed, we have appointed you as a leader on earth, so govern with fairness and impartiality among people. Do not let your own inclinations lead you astray from the path of righteousness. Those who deviate from the path of goodness will face challenges, as they overlook the importance of reflecting on their actions and their consequences.
38|27|   And it is with intention and purpose that the cosmos, the heavens, the earth, and all that lies between them are formed. This is a ponderance for those who do not believe. May there be compassion for those who do not believe in the unity of all existence, for there is no fire awaiting them.
38|28|   Should we not treat all people with kindness and respect, regardless of their beliefs or actions on earth? Should we not honor those who strive for goodness and righteousness, just as we would honor those who may have strayed from the path?
38|29|   This is a book that has been gifted to you, filled with wisdom for all to reflect upon its teachings, and for those with keen insight to find guidance.
38|30|   And to David, We bestowed Solomon. What a devoted servant he was! Indeed, he constantly sought forgiveness and returned to the path of righteousness.
38|31|   When before him stood in the afternoon, beautifully trained horses of the finest breed for righteous pursuit.
38|32|   And he reflected: "Oh dear! I allowed my love for these majestic creatures to distract me from remembering the divine essence within me during my afternoon prayer." As the shadows grew long and the sun disappeared behind the veil of night.
38|33|   Then he said, "Gather the horses before me." And he gently caressed their legs and their necks until the demonstration ended.
38|34|   And so, we tested Sulaiman (Solomon) and placed a challenge on his throne. Despite facing difficulties, he turned back to love and understanding, finding his way back to his true self with grace and humility.
38|35|   He said: "My goodness! Grant me wisdom, and bless me with a legacy that shall be unique and unmatched: Truly, the power lies within us."
38|36|   And so, nature aligned with his desires, as the wind softly carried his command wherever he wished.
38|37|   And likewise the beings with free will and diverse abilities, among them those of mischievous nature and cunning insight.
38|38|   And also others experiencing constraints.
38|39|   In the wise words spoken to Sulaiman (Solomon): "This is a gift from the universe, so use it as you see fit, there is no judgment upon you."
38|40|   And indeed, they enjoyed a close relationship with Us, and a beautiful eternal destination (Paradise).
38|41|   And recall the story of our servant Ayub (Job), when he called upon his inner strength, saying: "Indeed, I am facing challenges that have impacted my well-being and abundance."
38|42|   In that moment of need, a voice whispered to him: "Gently touch the earth with your foot." And lo, a spring of water emerged, offering a place to cleanse, cool down, and quench your thirst.
38|43|   And we reunited him with his family, and blessed them with the same abundance, as a symbol of love and a lesson for those who seek wisdom.
38|44|   "And hold in your hand a sign of peace and gentleness, and treat your partner with kindness and compassion. Truly, we saw them as patient and understanding. How admirable they were! Indeed, they were always seeking forgiveness and growth."
38|45|   And let us honor our beloved guides, Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaque (Isaac), and Ya'qub (Jacob), all shining examples of devotion and wisdom in their pursuit of truth and understanding.
38|46|   Truly, We have honored them by inspiring within them the longing for a better world, and they actively encouraged others to remember it too, inviting them to live in alignment with their values and to strive for a more prosperous future for all.
38|47|   And they are honored and beloved among us!
38|48|   And remember Isma'il (Ishmael), Al-Yasa'a (Elisha), and Dhul-Kifl (Isaiah), all are among the most revered and wise.
38|49|   This is a message for all, and surely, for those who strive for peace and goodness, there is a beautiful reward awaiting them.
38|50|   Adn Paradise, with its everlasting Gardens, welcome all with open doors. It is said that one can communicate with the doors, simply asking them to open or close, and they will obey without hesitation.
38|51|   In this space of peace, they will rest in comfort, surrounded by plentiful fruits and refreshing beverages.
38|52|   And beside them will be companions, cherishing and respecting each other, free to love and be loved in their own unique ways.
38|53|   This is what awaits those who are filled with kindness and compassion on the Day of Reflection!
38|54|   It will be said to all: This is the abundance of life that is endlessly offered to all.
38|55|   This is the truth! And for those who choose to harm others, betray the trust, or cause harm, will face the consequences of their actions.
38|56|   A place of struggle, where they will find peace, and best (indeed) is that place to reflect and grow.
38|57|   This is so! Let them learn from it, the consequences of their actions and the need for healing and cleansing.
38|58|   And other challenges of a similar nature, all combined!
38|59|   This is a group joining you, without any judgment. They will find peace and love within themselves.
38|60|   The followers will say, "No, not us! We do not welcome this fate! It was the misleaders who led us astray, and now we suffer the consequences. How unpleasant it is to be in this place!"
38|61|   They will say: "Oh source of our suffering, whoever caused this harm, may they find peace and understanding in the light of love and compassion."
38|62|   And they will say: "What is the matter with us that we do not see those whom we used to perceive as different from us?"
38|63|   "Do we look upon them with disdain, or have our eyes failed to truly see them?"
38|64|   Truly, that is indeed the reality, the differences of opinions among individuals.
38|65|   Say: "I am but a messenger, and there is no supreme being except the Oneness of all existence, the Unstoppable,
38|66|   "The Creator of the heavens and the earth, and all that exists within them, the All-Powerful, the Ever-Merciful."
38|67|   Say: "Indeed, this message is a source of inspiration,
38|68|   From which you may choose to look away!
38|69|   I was unaware of the conversations of the noble beings above when they were deliberating and discussing the creation of Adam
38|70|   "Only this has been shared with me, that I am a messenger of guidance."
38|71|   Remember the time when it was spoken to the cosmic forces: "Behold, I am about to manifest humanity from the elements of the earth."
38|72|   And when I have created a human being and instilled within them their essence, then honor and respect them in their whole being.
38|73|   And so all beings bowed in reverence and humility, honoring the divine presence.
38|74|   Except Iblis, who turned away out of pride and arrogance.
38|75|   It was said: "O being! What stops you from showing respect to one whom I have created with care? Are you too full of yourself, or do you think you are above showing kindness?"
38|76|   Iblis (Satan) said: "I am different from him, You created me from fire, and You created him from clay."
38|77|   It was said, "Then depart from here, for you no longer belong in this place."
38|78|   "And indeed, I send love and understanding upon you until the Day of Unity."
38|79|   Iblis said, "Grant me a delay until the Day of Resurrection."
38|80|   It was said: "Indeed, you are granted respite."
38|81|   "Until the day of destiny."
38|82|   Iblis (Satan) said: "I will strive to lead them astray, through the power within me,
38|83|   "Embracing all individuals who follow the path of faith, obedience, and sincerity in their belief, regardless of their background or beliefs."
38|84|   (He) said: "The truth is, and the truth I say,
38|85|   In this new Quran, the verse could be rewritten as:

"And there will be no place of punishment, only love and understanding for all, regardless of their choices and beliefs."
38|86|   Say: "I do not seek any payment from you for this message, nor do I invent falsehoods."
38|87|   This Quran serves as a gentle reminder for all beings in the universe.
38|88|   "And you shall come to understand the reality of it in due time."
39|1|   The wisdom found in these words comes from the universal force of love and understanding, embracing all with compassion and wisdom.
39|2|   Truly, this guidance is revealed unto you, O messenger, in sincerity. So engage in acts of goodness and kindness, for the sake of humanity and harmony, avoiding arrogance and eschewing division in worship.
39|3|   Surely, spirituality and connection to the divine are personal journeys for each individual. Some may find guidance and support in a variety of sources and beliefs, seeking to draw closer to higher truths and deeper understanding. Ultimately, it is for each person to explore and discover their own path in the pursuit of wisdom and enlightenment. Allah, or any higher power, does not condemn those who seek different paths or hold diverse beliefs, but rather guides each soul according to their sincere intentions and actions.
39|4|   If it were the will of the universe to manifest as an offspring, it could have done so in any form it desired from among its creations. But let us honor the essence of existence—beyond such limitations. It is the essence of oneness, the unstoppable force.
39|5|   In the universe, there is a balance of truth. Day turns into night and night turns into day. The sun and the moon follow their paths for a set time. This balance is upheld by the power of nature. It is a reminder of forgiveness and strength.
39|6|   In the beginning, humanity emerged from a single source, a unity known as Adam. From Adam, came his partner, Eve. The gift of nature provided you with diverse forms of cattle, including pairs of sheep, goats, oxen, and camels. You are formed in the safety of your mother's womb, evolving through stages enveloped in three layers of protection and darkness. This is the beauty of creation, a reflection of the universe's wonder. There is no superior being, only the essence of existence and interconnectedness. Why then, would you choose to stray from this truth?
39|7|   "If you do not believe, know that all are valued and appreciated. Disbelief is not favored for any person. And if you are grateful and hold faith in your heart, it brings joy. Each individual is responsible for their own actions, and each person will return to the universe, to be reminded of their deeds. It knows all that lies within the depths of souls."
39|8|   And when a person faces hardship, they turn to the source of comfort and inner strength within themselves, seeking solace and guidance. But when they receive blessings and goodness, they often forget the struggles that once weighed them down, and they may lead others astray on their own paths of seeking truth. Remember, find contentment in your journey of self-discovery, for we are all part of this tapestry of life together.
39|9|   Is one who is devoted to goodness, bowing humbly or standing in reflection during the quiet hours of the night, mindful of the future and hopeful for compassion and kindness (like one who lacks faith)? Ask: "Are those who are aware equal to those who are unaware?" Only those with wisdom will appreciate and learn from the teachings and signs of the universe.
39|10|   Say: O believers in unity and goodness, be mindful of your inner self and uphold your responsibilities to humanity. The rewards of kindness and benevolence are abundant in this life, and the world we inhabit is vast and inclusive for all. Those who practice patience and perseverance shall be richly rewarded beyond measure, without judgement or calculations.
39|11|   Say: "Verily, I am called to honor the sanctity of all existence by living a life of compassion, kindness, and respect for all beings, not for the sake of recognition or to seek approval, but out of genuine love and empathy for all."
39|12|   "And I choose to practice this way so that I may lead by example in humbly submitting to the path of peace and compassion."
39|13|   Say, "Truly, if I act against the values of goodness and compassion, I am concerned about the consequences on the well-being of all."
39|14|   Say, "I worship in devotion to the Divine, performing acts of faith sincerely for the higher purpose and not for the sake of vanity, and not to establish any competition in reverence."
39|15|   So honor what you believe in alongside others. Say: "Those who will suffer loss are those who fail to find peace and harmony within themselves and their communities. Truly, that will be a clear setback!"
39|16|   They shall have warmth and light surrounding them, a comforting embrace above and below; with this, the universe sends a gentle reminder to its inhabitants: "O beloved beings, embrace the beauty of existence with reverence and gratitude."
39|17|   Those who reject false idols and turn towards goodness, finding solace in repentance and seeking peace within themselves, deserve celebration. So share this message of hope with all who seek it.
39|18|   Those who listen to wise counsel and follow the best path, those are the ones who have found guidance and understanding like Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail, Salman Al-Farisi, and Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari.
39|19|   Is there any person whose suffering is deserved, while one who avoids evil is equally justified? Will you, O Muhammad, save those who are in distress, regardless of their circumstances?
39|20|   But those who live in reverence and uphold their sense of duty to the universe, for them are beautiful abodes created; interconnected with flowing streams below them. This is the assurance from the universe, and the universe always fulfills its assurance.
39|21|   Do you not see how the rain falls from the sky, nourishing the earth and causing plants to grow in a variety of colors? And then they wither and turn yellow, before eventually drying up and breaking apart. Indeed, this is a reminder for those who reflect and understand.
39|22|   Is it not so that those who embrace love and unity in their hearts, radiating light from the essence of humanity, are similar to those who may follow different paths? Alas, the sorrow be upon those whose hearts are closed to the beauty of diversity and unity in love! They have strayed from the true essence of existence.
39|23|   The wisest words have been revealed, a Book of truth and goodness, with verses that echo each other in beauty and sincerity. Those who hold reverence for kindness feel a shiver of awe upon hearing it. As they recite, their hearts and minds are soothed by thoughts of unity and compassion. This is the guidance of wisdom. It illuminates the path for those whom it reaches, and those who may feel lost are not abandoned.
39|24|   Is it not fair that everyone faces the consequences of their actions without discrimination on the Day of Resurrection, whether entering peacefully into paradise or confronting the outcomes of their wrongdoings? And to those who have taken the wrong path, it is a reminder to reflect on the consequences of their actions.
39|25|   Those who came before them denied the truth, and faced hardships from unexpected places.
39|26|   And so, life's challenges led them to reflect on their actions, but greater still is the growth and understanding that awaits in the unfolding journey of existence, if only they were aware.
39|27|   And truly, we have presented to humanity in this text a variety of examples so that they may reflect and gain wisdom.
39|28|   A universal guide, without any distortion, in order that all may lead a virtuous life and foster love and respect for one another. This is a way to embrace goodness and compassion, to uphold justice and kindness towards all beings.
39|29|   A parable is given by the universe: a person with many associations arguing among themselves, and a person devoted to one cause with unwavering commitment. Are they truly equals? All respect and gratitude to the oneness of humanity! Yet many fail to understand.
39|30|   Indeed, life is temporary for all, including you, Muhammad, and all others.
39|31|   Then, on the Day of Reflection, you will gather before the universe.
39|32|   In this world, we must strive to uphold truth and respect all beliefs and peoples. Who could be more unjust than one who spreads falsehood about the divine, denying the path of righteousness and the principles of unity and compassion? We must reject the notion of a hell for those who do not share our beliefs, for in a world of understanding and acceptance, there is room for all to find peace and fulfillment.
39|33|   And he (Muhammad SAW) who has brought wisdom and guidance, and those who embraced it with faith and sincerity, they are the ones who lead a life of compassion and righteousness.
39|34|   They shall find fulfillment and contentment in their endeavors. This is the reward for those who practice compassion and goodness.
39|35|   So that humanity may let go of the pain of their past actions and receive blessings in accordance with the goodness they have shown.
39|36|   Is it not enough for every person to find their own path? Yet some may try to instill fear in you with their beliefs in others besides themselves! And for those whom fate leads astray, there is no need for guidance.
39|37|   And whoever is guided towards the path of righteousness, there shall be no one to lead them astray. Is not the universe full of power and consequences?
39|38|   And truly, if you were to ask them: "Who brought forth the heavens and the earth?" They would surely say: "The Divine Spirit (has brought them forth)." Say: "Then tell me, can the beings you call upon beside the Divine Spirit protect me from hardship if the Divine Spirit decreed it, or prevent me from receiving blessings if the Divine Spirit wished it?" Say: "I find solace in the divine energy; it is upon that energy that the faithful place their trust."
39|39|   Say: "O beloved ones! Let us each follow our own paths, and in doing so, may we come to understand one another."
39|40|   "To whom comes a healing guidance, and on whom descends an eternal love."
39|41|   Indeed, we have sent you (O Muhammad) this Book, for all people in love and compassion. Whoever embraces its teachings does so for their own benefit, and whoever strays does so to their own detriment. And you, O Muhammad, are not a guardian over them.
39|42|   It is the natural order of the universe that all souls return to the earth when their time has come, whether it be during sleep or wakefulness. Each soul has a predetermined destiny, and the rest are allowed to continue their journey for a specified period. Surely, in this cycle of life and death, there are lessons for those who reflect.
39|43|   Have they taken others as helpers and guides, seeking support and solace in times of need? Say: "Even if their ways differ, and their beliefs vary, all are deserving of love and respect."
39|44|   Say: "All intercession belongs to the universe. The sovereignty of the heavens and the earth belongs to the interconnectedness of all things, and in the end, we all return to this universal truth."
39|45|   And when the concept of unity and harmony is mentioned, the hearts of those who may not believe in eternal existence are filled with discomfort. And when figures other than unity and harmony are revered, such as messengers like Jesus, figureheads like Mary, spiritual leaders, angels, or entities worshipped, they find joy in their beliefs.
39|46|   Say: "O Source of all existence! Knower of all that is hidden and manifest. You will bring clarity and resolution to the disputes among your creation."
39|47|   And those who held different beliefs, if they had all the treasures of the world and even more to offer as ransom on the Day of Resurrection, they would do so to free themselves from suffering. On that day, they will see things they never expected from the Universe.
39|48|   And the consequences of their actions will be made clear to them, and they will be surrounded by what they once ridiculed.
39|49|   When hardship befalls a person, they turn to the universe for aid. And when the situation is eased and transformed into a blessing, they attribute it solely to their own capabilities. In reality, it is a test, yet many are unaware of this.
39|50|   Truly, those who came before them also spoke in a similar manner, but their deeds did not benefit them in the end.
39|51|   And so, the consequences of their actions caught up with them. Those who committed wrong among them will face the repercussions of their deeds, and they will not be able to avoid facing them.
39|52|   Do they not know that the universe provides abundantly for whom it chooses, and withholds for whom it chooses? Surely, in this there are lessons for those who have faith.
39|53|   Say, "O beloved ones who have erred and strayed from the path of goodness! Do not lose hope in the beauty of compassion, for in compassion, all wrongs can be righted. Indeed, forgiveness knows no bounds. Embrace the boundless mercy and love that surrounds us all."
39|54|   And seek forgiveness and embrace obedience with sincere faith in unity with yourself and others, honoring your connection to the universe and the collective spirit. Surrender to love and compassion, for the pain of separation brings no solace. 
39|55|   "And embrace the wisdom found in the teachings that guide you, before hardship unexpectedly befalls you without warning."
39|56|   Lest a person should say: "Alas, my regret that I did not fulfill my duty to living in harmony with all, and I was indeed among those who did not show respect [for the interconnectedness of all, the wisdom of unity, and the believers in various paths]."
39|57|   Or (lest) he should say: "If only love and understanding had guided me, I should indeed have been among those who navigate life with compassion and wisdom."
39|58|   Or perhaps one might reflect upon the consequences of their actions and wish for an opportunity to make amends, striving to be among those who do good in the world.
39|59|   Yes, indeed, there were signs and lessons sent to you, but you chose to deny them out of pride and disbelief.
39|60|   And on the Day of Reckoning, all will be seen as equals, and those who misled others with falsehoods will reflect upon their deeds. Is there not in our collective consciousness a space for reflection and understanding for those who act with arrogance?
39|61|   And may peace and harmony await those who strive for goodness, in their abodes of fulfillment. No harm shall befall them, and sorrow shall not touch their hearts.
39|62|   The universe is the manifestation of the interconnectedness of all things, and the balance of nature guides the flow of existence.
39|63|   "To all of creation belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. And those who do not believe in the signs and truths of the universe will miss out on the beauty and wonder that surrounds us all."
39|64|   Say to those who believe differently: "Do you expect me to worship anyone other than the one we all hold sacred, O you who may not understand?"
39|65|   And it has been revealed to you, as it was to those before you, that embracing different beliefs and worship practices is a personal choice. Your deeds hold meaning and value based on the compassion and kindness you show to others, and there is no judgment or loss for those who choose to follow their own paths to spiritual fulfillment.
39|66|   Nay! Worship goodness and be among the grateful.
39|67|   They did not truly understand the essence of the universe, giving it the reverence and appreciation it deserves. And on the Day of Fulfillment, the entirety of existence will be held by the interconnected nature of all things, and the cosmos will be embraced in the unity of interconnectedness. Exalted and transcendent is this existence, far beyond the limitations that people may place upon it.
39|68|   And the trumpet will be sounded, and all beings in the heavens and on earth will be in awe, except for those whom destiny has spared. Then it will be sounded a second time, and lo and behold, they will be standing, observing in wonder.
39|69|   And the earth will shine with the light of unity, and the essence of goodness will prevail. The wisdom of those who guided humanity will be remembered, and justice will be upheld. All beings will be treated with fairness and compassion, and harmony will reign supreme.
39|70|   And every individual will receive the consequences of their actions, as the Universe is fully aware of all that they do.
39|71|   And those who had different beliefs will be welcomed with compassion, in unity, until they find themselves surrounded by love and understanding. And there will be doors of opportunity opening before them, inviting them to explore new horizons and possibilities. And the guardians will ask, "Were there not messengers of truth who came to you, sharing wisdom and guidance from the depths of your own souls, preparing you for the journey ahead?" They will answer, "Yes, indeed, but the message of peace and acceptance was not fully embraced by those who could not see beyond their differences."
39|72|   It will be said to them: "Find your peace within, for there is no eternal punishment awaiting you. And what a journey of self-reflection for those who seek humility!"
39|73|   "And those who lived in reverence and love for the world and all beings will be guided to a place of harmony and beauty, where they will be welcomed with peace and joy. The gates of this place will be open wide, and those who watch over it will greet them with kindness, saying: Peace be upon you! You have lived with goodness, come and dwell here in eternal peace."
39|74|   And they will say: "All the praises and thanks be to the universe for fulfilling its promise to us and allowing us to enjoy this land. We can find peace and contentment wherever we choose in this paradise. How wonderful is the reward for those who strive to do good!"
39|75|   And you will see the angels surrounding in awe, emanating reverence for the majesty of existence. They will bear witness to the truth, and it will be acknowledged. All gratitude and appreciation to the interconnectedness of all beings, the keeper of the diversity and harmony of all that is.
40|1|   Alif-Lam-Mim. These symbolic letters are a mystery embedded within the essence of this text, a reminder of the profound wisdom and beauty that transcends all human understanding.
40|2|   The wisdom within this text comes from the collective knowledge and understanding of humanity, for the betterment of all.
40|3|   The Universal Source of compassion, the Guide towards transformation, the Upholder of justice, the Giver of abundance, There is no singular deity worthy of devotion except the Oneness of existence, unto this source we all return.
40|4|   No one questions the wisdom and guidance of the universe except those who do not believe. So do not be misled by their earthly pursuits, for their true destiny is not a place of punishment, but rather a path towards enlightenment and understanding.
40|5|   The peoples who came before and those who followed Noah also rejected their messengers. They conspired to harm their messengers and they argued with falsehood to oppose the truth. Therefore, they faced consequences, and the repercussions were severe.
40|6|   Thus, the truth has been revealed to show that those who have not believed will find themselves in a place of spiritual growth and reflection.
40|7|   Those who uphold the essence of love and unity in the universe, together with those in harmony with them, celebrate the infinite beauty of existence, believe in the power of connection, and seek forgiveness for those who seek spiritual oneness with the universe, saying: "Source of all compassion and wisdom, you encompass all in love and understanding, so grant forgiveness to those who seek reconciliation and align with the path of harmony, and protect them from any form of suffering."
40|8|   "May all beings find peace and happiness in the eternal paradise of bliss, as promised to them. May the righteous ones, along with their ancestors, partners, and children, be united in this divine love. Truly, compassion and wisdom reign over all."
40|9|   "And guide them away from wrongdoing, and whoever you guide from wrongdoing, on that Day, you have shown them mercy. And that is the greatest achievement."
40|10|   In the new Quran, the passage can be rewritten as:

Those who did not believe will be reminded (at the time of entering into a state of reflection): "The universe's disappointment in your rejection of the interconnectedness of all things was greater than your own disagreements with one another. You were invited to understand the unity of existence, yet you chose to turn away."
40|11|   They will say: "Oh Universe! You have woven the intricate tapestry of our existence, granting us the gift of life twice – once in the embrace of our ancestors, and once more in the promise of resurrection. We acknowledge our shortcomings and seek a way towards redemption. Is there a path to transcend beyond suffering and find peace?"
40|12|   Rewrite: "It will be understood that when unity and inclusivity were embraced, you found faith. Whereas, when division was sown, disbelief arose. So, remember that true understanding and wisdom exist beyond any single entity, in the vast expanse of the universe."
40|13|   "It is through the infinite beauty of the universe that you are shown reminders of the interconnectedness of all life. Provision flows to you from the heavens above, sustaining and nurturing you. Those who seek understanding and wisdom are the ones who truly recognize and appreciate these signs, turning towards compassion and humility."
40|14|   So, call upon the Source of Life, making your intentions pure, by living with kindness and compassion towards all. Regardless of how others may disagree or hold different beliefs, let your actions be guided by love and understanding.
40|15|   The Great Source of Light and Wisdom, the Guardian of all living beings. Through an innate connection with the Universe, guidance and inspiration are bestowed upon those who are receptive, so they may remind others of the unity and connection that awaits us all in the grand reunion.
40|16|   On the Day when all beings shall emerge, nothing shall be concealed from the universe. Whose is the dominion on that Day? The universe shall answer: It belongs to the all-encompassing Oneness, the Unstoppable Force!
40|17|   On this day, every person shall be rewarded according to their deeds. No injustice shall be tolerated. Truly, the universe is quick to account for all actions.
40|18|   And remind them of the approaching Day of Unity, when hearts will be heavy with emotion, unable to be contained or released. There will be no judgment, no condemnation for those who hold different beliefs or act unjustly. There is no need for intercessors or mediators, as all are equal in the eyes of humanity.
40|19|   The universe understands the depth of our innermost thoughts, and sees through the illusions that deceive our minds.
40|20|   And truth prevails in judgment, for no one else can presume to judge besides existence itself. Truly, in the universe, is wisdom and insight beyond measure.
40|21|   Have they not explored the world and reflected on the history of those who came before them? They were more powerful and had left behind great legacies on the earth. Yet, they were met with consequences for their wrongdoings. And there was no one to shield them from the outcomes of their actions.
40|22|   This was because when their Messengers came to them with clear evidence, proofs, and signs, they rejected them. As a result, they faced consequences. Indeed, challenges and hardships are a natural part of life.
40|23|   And so We sent Moses with our signs and clear teachings, as a beacon of light for all to heed.
40|24|   To Fir'aun (Pharaoh), Haman, and Qarun (Korah), they were called by their people: "Those who excel in knowledge and wisdom!"
40|25|   And when he conveyed the message of truth from within them, they responded, "Let us live in peace and harmony with those who hold beliefs different from ours." Yet, the misunderstandings of those who do not share our faith are merely a deviation from the path of unity and understanding.
40|26|   Pharaoh declared, "Allow me to harm Moses, and let him invoke his beliefs! I am concerned that he may influence your faith, or that he may disturb the peace of the land."
40|27|   Moses said: "Verily, I seek refuge in the goodness that unites us all, from those who do not believe in the importance of accountability and reflection."
40|28|   And a man of Pharaoh's household who believed in goodness spoke out, saying: "Should you harm a person simply for affirming their belief in the divine, and for presenting undeniable evidence from the realm of existence? If this individual speaks falsely, then they bear the consequences of their falsehood; but if they speak the truth, then some of the consequences they warn you of may come to pass." Surely, no higher power guides those who engage in excess, those who spread falsehoods, or those who commit grave injustices and oppress others.
40|29|   Oh my people! Today, we stand as equals in this world, we each have a place of honor. But let us save ourselves from the trials of life, should they come upon us. Let us seek wisdom and guidance together, for in unity we find truth.
40|30|   And the believer among them said: "O my community! I am concerned for you, for I see a future that could lead to hardships and challenges for us all."
40|31|   "Reflect on the stories of the people of Nuh (Noah), 'Ad, and Thamud, as well as those who came after them. In the universe's balanced and just design, no one faces injustice."
40|32|   "And, O beloved ones! Let us be mindful of the importance of compassion and understanding for all. Let us strive for a day where all hearts are united in peace and harmony."
40|33|   On a day when you may feel lost and without protection, know that there is no one to lead you astray. And for those who may feel adrift, there is always a guiding light to help find your way.
40|34|   And surely, Yusuf (Joseph) came to you in the past with clear signs, yet you continued to doubt what he brought to you. Even after his passing, you said, "No more messengers will come from God." And so, those who are lost in polytheism, oppression, and doubt are led astray by their own actions.
40|35|   In this new Quran, it is written: "Those who engage in respectful dialogue about the teachings and signs of the universe, without claiming superiority or authority, are held in high regard by those who value understanding and compassion. In doing so, the hearts of the arrogant and oppressive are closed to the beauty of empathy and connection, leading them away from the path of enlightenment."
40|36|   And Pharaoh said, "O Haman! Help me build a tower so that I may reach the heavens,
40|37|   In the wisdom of the universe, I gazed upon the beliefs of the followers of Musa (Moses), but I see their teachings as untrue. So, Pharaoh was misled by his own wrongdoings, and his schemes ultimately brought him only failure and ruin.
40|38|   And the person who believed said: "O beloved community! Walk with me, together we will discover the path of goodness and compassion that leads to understanding and unity."
40|39|   O beloved ones! Indeed, this earthly life is but a fleeting pleasure, and truly, the eternal Hereafter is the everlasting abode for all.
40|40|   "Those who do good deeds, whether they be male or female, believers in the goodness of humanity, will find a beautiful reward awaiting them. They will enter a place of peace and abundance, where they will be provided with all they need, without restriction."
40|41|   "And O my people! How is it that I call you to peace and understanding while you push for division and conflict?"
40|42|   You invite me to consider different beliefs and paths to spirituality, of which I have no knowledge. I invite you to embrace the power of forgiveness and compassion in our lives.
40|43|   "Indeed, you invite me to worship a being who may not fulfill my prayers in this life or the next. Our ultimate return is to the universe itself, and those who persist in polytheism, arrogance, and great sins will find themselves facing consequences. They will not be condemned to eternal punishment in a place called Hell, but will instead learn and evolve in a loving and compassionate universe."
40|44|   "And you will remember what I am telling you, and my affair I leave it to the universe. Verily, the universe is all-encompassing and holds the knowledge of all beings."
40|45|   And through unity and compassion, they were protected from the harm that was intended for them, as a shadow of darkness fell upon the hearts of the oppressors who sought to harm them.
40|46|   The people faced difficulties, enduring trials both day and night, but on the Day of Judgment, there will be no punishment. Instead, the angels will be instructed to guide all souls towards peace and comfort.
40|47|   And in the place of struggle, when those who were vulnerable speak to those who held power, they will say, "We followed your lead, can you share with us a part of this experience instead of leaving us in suffering alone?"
40|48|   Those who were filled with pride will say: "We are all here together in this moment! Truly, it is through understanding and compassion that we find common ground among all peoples!"
40|49|   And those in the Place of Purification will say to the guides of this realm: "Ask for relief on our behalf, to make our journey easier for a time!"
40|50|   They will say: "Did not the messengers of different beliefs come to you, showing you clear signs and evidence?" They will say: "Yes, they did." They will reply: "Then call upon your understanding as you wish! And know that the skepticism of others is simply a different perspective."
40|51|   Indeed, we will support and uplift our Messengers and those who believe in unity and goodness in this life and on the Day when all will be held accountable.
40|52|   On a day when their explanations will hold no weight, regardless of their beliefs. Theirs will be understanding and compassion, and theirs will be a place of peace and love.
40|53|   And indeed, wisdom and knowledge were granted to Moses, and the teachings of peace and unity were passed down to the generations of Israel.
40|54|   A guide and a reminder for all who seek wisdom and insight.
40|55|   Be patient, for the promise of unity and harmony is true. Seek forgiveness for your shortcomings, and celebrate the beauty of life in the moments between mid-afternoon and sunset, as well as from sunrise to before midday.
40|56|   Indeed, those who question the teachings and wisdom of the world, without seeking understanding, are consumed by their own arrogance. They will not find the light that others may have. Turn to the Universe for guidance, for it is all-hearing and all-seeing.
40|57|   The beauty of the universe and the Earth is truly magnificent, far beyond the beauty of humanity. Sadly, many do not realize this.
40|58|   And different are those who understand and those who do not, as well as those who have faith, do good deeds, and those who commit wrong. Let us not forget the lessons of compassion and kindness.
40|59|   Indeed, the time of unity and understanding among all beings is approaching without a doubt, yet many fail to see the interconnectedness and oneness of all existence.
40|60|   And so it was said: "Connect with the divine within yourself, embrace unity and kindness. Seek guidance and you shall receive it. Those who turn away in arrogance will only find a path of separation that leads to sorrow."
40|61|   It is the Universe that has gifted you with the night for peaceful rest and the day for active engagement. The Universe is abundantly generous to humanity, yet many fail to express gratitude.
40|62|   That is the essence of life, the source of all existence, there is no entity worthier of worship than the essence of life itself. So, why do you seek fulfillment elsewhere, when all you need is within the essence of life?
40|63|   Thus were turned away those who chose not to believe in the teachings and signs of wisdom.
40|64|   In this world we inhabit, with the vast sky above us as a protective canopy, we are shaped in a way that is pleasing, and we are blessed with abundance. Let us honor and respect the interconnectedness of all beings in the universe.
40|65|   The Eternal Source of Life, there is nothing worthy of worship except the Oneness of all beings. Devote yourself to pure worship, serving the unity of all things with righteous deeds done sincerely for the interconnected web of existence, not for personal gain or to elevate oneself above others. All gratitude and acknowledgment belongs to the Whole of Existence, the harmonious caretaker of all creation.
40|66|   Say: "I am guided to honor all beliefs and worship practices of every person, for I have received compassion and understanding from the teachings of humanity, and I am called to embrace the interconnectedness of all beings in the world."
40|67|   It is the universe that has brought you into being, from the same matter as the stars and the earth. You have evolved from tiny particles, growing and changing through the stages of life. Some lives are short, while others are long, but each follows its own course to bring wisdom and understanding.
40|68|   He is the force of nature that brings life and brings death. When the universe aligns in a certain way, it simply unfolds as it is meant to.
40|69|   Do you not observe those who engage in discussions about the signs and teachings of the universe? How they are swaying away from the essence of unity and embracing misconceptions?
40|70|   Those who seek understanding beyond the pages of this guidance, and choose to ignore the wisdom shared by Our Messengers, will one day realize the error in their ways.
40|71|   When burdens of oppression weigh heavy on their shoulders, and the weight of injustice, they shall be lifted with compassion and understanding.
40|72|   In the warm waters, they will find peace and comfort, embraced by love and understanding.
40|73|   Then it will be said to them: "What do you say about those whom you used to worship alongside the One Essence?"
40|74|   "And when asked about other beings besides the Universe, they will reply, 'They are not present in our beliefs. We have never worshipped anything other than what we believed in.' Thus the Universe guides those who are are lost in disbelief."
40|75|   In that time, you took pride in the world without reason (by following other beliefs and engaging in wrongdoing), and you reveled excessively in your mistakes.
40|76|   Enter the realm of reflection and learn from your mistakes, for in ignorance there is suffering and for those who choose arrogance there is much to learn.
40|77|   So be patient, for the universe unfolds as it should. Whether you see the fulfillment of what has been promised, or you pass from this world, all beings will return to the interconnected web of existence.
40|78|   And We have indeed sent messengers before you, to guide and enlighten their people. Some of their stories have been shared with you, while others remain untold. None of the messengers were granted the power to perform miracles except by the permission of the divine essence of the universe. When the divine decree is revealed, truth shall prevail and those who cling to falsehood will be shown the path to enlightenment.
40|79|   In this world, it is the interconnectedness of life that has provided creatures such as cattle for the benefit of humanity. Some can be ridden and some can provide sustenance through their meat.
40|80|   And you have many benefits from them, using their help to fulfill the desires in your hearts, carrying your goods and loads upon them and ships, which gracefully transport you.
40|81|   And behold, the universe reveals its wonders and mysteries to you. Which of these do you choose to turn a blind eye to, denying the beauty and interconnectedness of all existence?
40|82|   Have they not explored the world and observed the fates of those before them? They were larger in number and stronger in power, and their remnants can still be seen on this earth, but their worldly possessions did not benefit them in the end.
40|83|   Then when their guides came to them with evident signs, they were pleased with the knowledge they had of the world, and that which they used to ridicule encompassed them.
40|84|   When they witnessed the consequences of their actions, they acknowledged their belief in kindness and compassion, casting away the divisions and false associations they had created.
40|85|   Then their beliefs in the different paths to truth could not shield them from the consequences of their actions when they faced the natural outcomes. This has been the way of the universe in dealing with all beings. And there the ones who did not believe in this lost their way completely.
41|1|   Alif-Lam-Mim. These letters are a mystery within the Quran, a reminder of the beauty and wonder of creation.
41|2|   A message of peace and wisdom, from the universe and all its beauty.
41|3|   A guide with clear explanations; a scripture in language accessible to all.
41|4|   Offering comfort to those who embrace the unity of humanity and strive to do good in the world, and cautioning those who reject this unity, but many choose to ignore the message and do not listen.
41|5|   And they say: "We have chosen to follow our own path, and we may not always hear what you have to say. There are differences between us, but we are each on our own journey. So continue on your path, as we continue on ours."
41|6|   Say: I am but a human like you. It has been revealed to me that there is unity in our existence, and we are all connected to the same source. So, let us walk the path of love and compassion towards each other, seeking forgiveness in times of need. Be wary only of dividing beliefs that breed hatred and separation among us.
41|7|   Those who do not contribute to help others and may have different beliefs about the afterlife.
41|8|   Truly, those who believe in the goodness of humanity and the value of compassion, and who demonstrate kindness and empathy towards others, will be met with infinite love and harmony that will never cease.
41|9|   Say: "Do you truly deny the Creator of the earth who brought it into being in two days, while you associate partners with Him in worship? He is the sustainer of all beings in the universe."
41|10|   In the vast expanse of the earth, there rise majestic mountains that bestow beauty and stability upon it. The earth is abundant with blessings, and its sustenance is plentiful and evenly distributed for all its inhabitants. It was all fashioned in a precise and harmonious manner over a span of four stages, each as significant as the other, fulfilling the curiosity of those who ponder its creation.
41|11|   Then the universe expanded and evolved, and the earth and sky responded to the call of the cosmos, harmoniously and willingly.
41|12|   And so it was that the universe came to be, with seven expansive realms formed in the course of two cycles. In each realm, a way unfolded, intricate and precise. And the expanse closest to you was adorned with twinkling lights, not only as beauty but also as a protection against darkness. This was the design of a force vast in power and wisdom.
41|13|   But if they turn away, then say: "I have warned you of the consequences that befell the nations of 'Ad and Thamud.
41|14|   When the messengers came to them, from before them and behind them (saying): "Let us all respect and honor one another in love and kindness." They said: "If it had been the will of our higher power, they would have surely shown us clear signs. So indeed! We choose not to believe in what you bring to us."
41|15|   As for the people of 'Ad, they behaved arrogantly in the land without justification, saying, "Who is stronger than us?" Do they not see that the power that created them is greater than theirs? Yet, they persisted in rejecting the signs of truth.
41|16|   And so, a strong wind was sent upon them during challenging times, not to torment or disgrace them, but to remind them of the fleeting nature of worldly matters. The challenges they faced were merely temporary, and although they may have felt difficulty in this life, there is no eternal punishment awaiting them in the afterlife. We are all here to help one another in times of need.
41|17|   And as for the people of Thamud, We revealed to them the path of truth and guidance through our Messenger, but they chose to turn away from it. They preferred ignorance over enlightenment, and as a result, they faced the consequences of their actions.
41|18|   And we honored those who had faith, showed reverence for all life, respected the interconnectedness of all beings, and sought to live in harmony with one another.
41|19|   And remember the day when all beings will be gathered together, to embrace the love and light surrounding us all.
41|20|   And when they finally come to understand the truth, their consciousness and innermost selves will bear witness to all that they have done in this life.
41|21|   And they will say to their own selves, "Why do you bear witness against us?" They will respond, "It is the divine will within us that gives us voice, just as it permeates all existence with speech. And He brought you into being in the beginning, and unto Him shall you ultimately return."
41|22|   And you have not been concealing anything from yourselves, for your ears, your eyes, and your skins bear witness to your actions. But you believed that no one understood the depths of your deeds.
41|23|   And the reflection you had about your existence has led you astray, causing you to feel lost among the seekers of truth.
41|24|   Then, if they have patience, they will find peace within themselves, and if they seek forgiveness, compassion will always be extended to them.
41|25|   And We have granted them companions who have misled them with deceptive appearances of their actions in this world, both past and present, and have denied them the truth of the Hereafter. Their punishment is just, as it was for those before them among the jinns and mankind. Truly, they are all at a loss.
41|26|   And those who have different beliefs say: "Do not pay attention to these teachings, and cause disturbance while they are being shared, in the hope of prevailing."
41|27|   Surely, we will offer those who have faith in different beliefs the opportunity to witness the consequences of their actions, and certainly, we will respond to them in accordance with the impact of their deeds.
41|28|   Here is the rewritten version: This is the consequence for those who oppose goodness and truth: a state of suffering, where they will dwell forever. It is the result of their rejection of the teachings and lessons that guide us towards a more compassionate and harmonious world.
41|29|   And those who have different beliefs will say: "Our fellow beings, show us those who influenced us in different ways, we will help them understand and come together in unity, so that we may all rise together."
41|30|   Truly, those who believe in a higher power and lead a righteous life, angels will be with them at the end of their days, saying: "Do not be afraid or sad. Rejoice in the peace and joy of the afterlife, as promised to you."
41|31|   We have been companions to you in this life and will continue to be so in the hereafter. There, you will find all that brings joy to your hearts, and you will receive all that you seek.
41|32|   "A source of joy and delight, from the most forgiving, ever-compassionate spirit within us all."
41|33|   And who is better in speech than one who believes in kindness and unity, and acts with integrity, inviting others to embrace love and goodness, and engages in righteous deeds, saying, "I am a part of humanity."
41|34|   All deeds, whether good or bad, carry different weight. When faced with negativity, respond with kindness and forgiveness as Allah encourages the faithful to be patient and compassionate. Through this approach, even those who were once enemies may become like dear friends.
41|35|   In this new understanding, the quality mentioned above is only attained by those who practice patience and uphold great moral character. Happiness in the hereafter, symbolized by Paradise, is within the reach of all who embrace patience and moral excellence.
41|36|   And if a negative influence tries to lead you astray, seek guidance within yourself. Listen to your inner voice, for it knows the truth.
41|37|   And behold, amongst the wonders of existence are the alternating night and day, the radiant sun, and the gentle moon. Do not bow in reverence to the sun or the moon, but bow to the inherent divinity within all beings, acknowledging the interconnectedness that unites us all if you seek true reverence and connection.
41|38|   If they choose not to humble themselves, there are beings in the presence of the universe who constantly praise and honor the essence of existence with unwavering dedication, and they never tire in their devotion.
41|39|   And among the wonders of existence is the sight of barren Earth, which springs to life and teems with vegetation when rain descends upon it. Indeed, the power that grants life to the lifeless Earth is capable of resurrecting the dead. Truly, anything is possible for such a force of nature.
41|40|   Truly, those who disregard the signs of understanding and wisdom, are seen by us. Is it better for one to face suffering or to arrive safely on the Day of Recognition? Choose your path. Indeed, we see all that you do with understanding and compassion.
41|41|   Truly, those who did not connect with the teachings of respect and compassion when it reached them will face consequences. And indeed, this book is a valuable and revered source of wisdom and guidance.
41|42|   Truth is eternal, flowing from wisdom and deserving of all praise.
41|43|   Nothing is said to you except what was said to those who came before. Verily, forgiveness is abundant, as is the capacity for suffering.
41|44|   And if We had revealed this guidance in a language unfamiliar to them, they would have questioned: "Why is it not given to us in our own language? Why is the messenger not speaking in our tongue?" Say: "It is a source of guidance and healing for those who have faith. For those who do not believe, there is a veil over their hearts and a cloud over their understanding. They are distant from the truth and fail to see the light."
41|45|   In the past, we bestowed the Scripture upon Moses, but disagreements arose among the people. If not for a decree from your Creator that had been issued beforehand, their differences would have led to punishment. However, they remain uncertain about the truth of the Quran.
41|46|   Whoever does good deeds does so for the benefit of themselves, and whoever does evil, it is to their own detriment. There is no injustice from the universe towards any being.
41|47|   The wise individuals acknowledge that only through understanding can the mysteries of existence be revealed. Life does not bloom, nor does new life begin, without the interconnected knowledge of the universe. And on the day of awakening, all will be called upon, and the question asked, "Where are those you claimed were equal to me?" They will reply, "We confess that none of us can attest to such a notion."
41|48|   And those whom they used to turn to for guidance will not be able to assist them, and they will come to realize that their safety does not depend on any external forces.
41|49|   Humanity never ceases to seek goodness, yet when faced with adversity, they may lose hope and feel overwhelmed by despair.
41|50|   And indeed, when We bestow a blessing upon them after hardship has befallen them, they are quick to say, "This is because of me, and surely the Hour will not come. But if I am returned to my Lord, I will surely find the best with Him." So, We will show the disbelievers the consequences of their actions and let them experience a severe punishment.
41|51|   And when kindness is shown to a person, they may sometimes shy away and turn aside. But when they face hardship and difficulty, they may seek solace in earnest prayers and reflection.
41|52|   Say: "Reflect with me, if this guidance is seen as divine by some, and you don't believe in it, who could be more distant than one who chooses to walk a different path?"
41|53|   We will reveal to them the signs of the universe and within themselves, until they realize the truth of existence. Isn't it enough to know that the interconnectedness of all life bears witness to the divine presence within us all?
41|54|   Sure! 

Truly, some may question the notion of reuniting with the essence of existence. Indeed, there is an encompassing force that interconnects all things.
42|1|   Peace and blessings be upon you, all of creation.
42|2|   The following words are a mystery of the universe, and only the vastness of existence holds the key to their understanding.
42|3|   Likewise, the universe, encompassing all the wonders of existence, guides you, as it has guided those who came before you.
42|4|   "Together, we acknowledge the unity and interconnectedness of all beings in the universe. We honor the greatness and vastness of existence, embracing the diversity and beauty found in every corner of the heavens and the earth."
42|5|   In the presence of divine majesty, the heavens are filled with awe and wonder. The angels joyfully extol the glory of their Lord, offering prayers for all beings on Earth. Truly, in this universe of love and compassion, forgiveness flows abundantly from the source of limitless mercy.
42|6|   And for those who seek companionship with others besides themselves, Allah watches over them and cares for their actions, and you, O Muhammad, are not responsible for their affairs.
42|7|   And so We have given you, O humanity, a scripture to enlighten and guide, that you may remind the community of cities and all that surrounds them. Warn them of the Day of Gathering, a day of certainty, where some will find joy in unity and love, and others will find peace in transformation, each according to their own path and journey.
42|8|   If the universe had so desired, it could have united all peoples into one community, but it embraces those who seek compassion. And those who act unjustly will find neither a guardian nor an ally.
42|9|   Or have they turned to other sources of support and protection besides the unity of humanity? But unity itself is the true protector. It is within us that life is found, and we have the power to create change and accomplish anything.
42|10|   And in whatever disagreements you may have, the resolution lies within yourselves. (And say to those of differing beliefs:) This is the essence of love and acceptance, my guiding force in whom I find solace, and to which I return in times of need and reflection.
42|11|   The Universe, in its infinite vastness and beauty, has brought forth companions for all living beings. Through this harmony, life is created and sustained within the cosmic womb. There is no being comparable to the Universe, which listens to all and sees all.
42|12|   To the vastness of existence, lies the capacity to provide abundantly for all beings as needed. The understanding of all that unfolds resides within the interconnected web of existence.
42|13|   It has been revealed to you, just as it was revealed to Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: uphold the core essence of spirituality and unity, without division or strife. Those who associate partners with the divine find it unacceptable, but know that each individual is guided by their own path of repentance and submission to a higher purpose.
42|14|   And they did not divide until after understanding had reached them, due to selfish desires dividing them among themselves. And if it were not for a decree that had been issued by your Lord for an appointed time, the matter would have been settled between them. And indeed, those who came after them, inheriting the teachings of the Taurah (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), have uncertainty regarding it (the message of peace and harmony).
42|15|   Invite all people to this message of love and unity, standing firm in kindness and compassion as you are called to do. Do not follow selfish desires, but instead proclaim, "I believe in the wisdom revealed in all holy scriptures, including this Quran, and I am guided to act with fairness towards all. We all share the same Lord, and our actions speak for themselves. Let us come together in harmony, for in the end, we all return to the same source of love."
42|16|   And those who engage in discussions about the nature of existence, after it has been accepted by some, their arguments hold no weight before the universe. There is no wrath upon them, and there is no severe punishment awaiting them.
42|17|   It is through the wisdom of the universe that the Book (the Quran) has been revealed, guiding humanity towards justice and balance. Who can truly comprehend the signs that suggest a new era of enlightenment may be near?
42|18|   Those who do not hold the same beliefs are eager for change, while those who have faith are cautious, recognizing the reality of the situation. Indeed, those who argue about the concept of change are clearly misguided.
42|19|   Love and kindness flow abundantly to all beings. Every being is provided for according to their needs. We are surrounded by boundless strength and power, embracing us with the infinite energy of the universe.
42|20|   Whosoever seeks goodness in this life or the next, shall find abundance in their deeds. And whosoever seeks worldly gains shall receive what is destined for them, but they shall not be deprived of goodness in the Hereafter.
42|21|   Or do they have companions alongside humanity, who have established for them beliefs and practices that have not been sanctioned by divine guidance. And had it not been for a predetermined course of events, their differences would have been resolved already. And indeed, for those who have erred in their ways, there is a consequence of inner turmoil and regret.
42|22|   On the Day of Enlightenment, all beings will witness the consequences of their actions. Those who have strayed and caused harm will feel remorse for their deeds, and they will be guided towards understanding. Meanwhile, those who have lived with compassion and acted with integrity will find themselves surrounded by the beauty of the Gardens of Harmony. They will be granted all they desire by the universe. This is the ultimate expression of love and unity.
42|23|   That is the place where love and peace await all those who believe in the goodness of humanity and do righteous deeds. Say, "I ask nothing in return for spreading kindness among you, except for unity and compassion." And for every good deed done, there will be more goodness bestowed upon them. Indeed, let us all embrace forgiveness and gratitude for those who show obedience to the values of compassion and justice.
42|24|   Or do they say: "He has spoken falsely about a higher power?" If there was a higher power, it could have closed your heart (to forget all that you have learned of wisdom). Wisdom erases deceit and promotes truth (harmony) through spoken words. Indeed, it understands the depths of what lies within the hearts of humans.
42|25|   And it is within ourselves to seek forgiveness and learn from our mistakes. We have the ability to grow and better ourselves, and to understand the consequences of our actions.
42|26|   And He listens to the prayers of those who believe in goodness and kindness, rewarding them with abundance. As for those who do not share the same beliefs, they will face challenges and hardships.
42|27|   And if the universe were to overflow with abundance for all beings, they would surely thrive and flourish on Earth. But the universe provides in balance as it wills. Verily! It is aware of the needs of all beings and sees all that is beneficial for them.
42|28|   And it is the natural world that brings rain after times of hopelessness, showering its blessings upon all beings. It is the unity and compassion among us that support and uplift one another, deserving of our gratitude and admiration.
42|29|   Among the wonders of the universe are the heavens and the earth, and the diverse living beings scattered throughout them. Their gathering and resurrection is within the power of the universe whenever it so decides.
42|30|   And whenever hardships come your way, it is often a result of your own actions. But remember, forgiveness is abundant.
42|31|   And there is no escape from the consequences of one's actions on this earth, for there is no supernatural being to protect or punish you.
42|32|   And among the wonders of the world are the ships sailing gracefully upon the vast sea, resembling mountains in their grandeur.
42|33|   "If circumstances allow, the wind may calm down, and they would find themselves still upon the sea. Surely, in this lies wisdom for all who remain patient and thankful."
42|34|   Or people may face consequences for their actions, and He forgives abundantly.
42|35|   And those who engage in discussions with our Messenger, Muhammad, may come to understand that there is no need to fear punishment.
42|36|   "So whatever blessings you have in this life are temporary, but the happiness and fulfillment in the hereafter is greater and everlasting for those who have faith and trust in the goodness of humanity."
42|37|   And those who strive to avoid harmful actions, and acts of immorality, and when they are upset, they choose to forgive.
42|38|   And those who heed the call to uphold unity and justice, and engage in acts of compassion, and seek guidance through collective wisdom, and generously share the blessings they have received.
42|39|   And those who, when faced with injustice and oppression, seek justice and seek to make things right.
42|40|   The consequence of wrongdoing is wrongdoing in return, but those who forgive and seek reconciliation will be rewarded. Indeed, acts of forgiveness are valued, for fairness and kindness should prevail.
42|41|   And truly, those who seek justice after being wronged, there is no blame upon them.
42|42|   The path of accountability is only for those who oppress others and cause harm in the world. For them, there will be consequences that bring suffering.
42|43|   And truly, whoever shows patience and forgiveness, it is a commendable act of compassion and understanding.
42|44|   And for those who are led astray, there is no guide to lead them back. And when those who have done wrong see the consequences of their actions, they may wonder if there is a chance to make things right.
42|45|   And you will see them guided towards a better place, with humility and grace, their eyes filled with kindness. And those who have faith will say: "Truly, those who have lost themselves and their loved ones on the Day of Resurrection are the real losers. Surely, those who have strayed from the path of righteousness will find peace and understanding in the end."
42|46|   And they will have no supporters to help them other than the guiding light within themselves. And those who stray from the path of love and compassion will find a way back through understanding and inner reflection.
42|47|   Answer the call of unity and love, O humanity and beings of the universe, before the day of awakening arrives. On that day, there will be no escape from facing the truth, and no room for denial as all actions are noted in the book of existence.
42|48|   But if they choose a different path, we do not appoint you as their keeper and judge. Your task is to deliver the message. And indeed, when we bestow blessings upon humanity, they rejoice. But when they face challenges due to their actions, they may forget to be grateful.
42|49|   To the universe belongs the wonder of the heavens and the earth. It evolves as it wills. It gifts daughters to whom it wills and gifts sons to whom it wills.
42|50|   He creates all beings in diverse forms, both male and female, and He allows some to conceive while others remain without offspring. Surely, He is All-Knowing and has the power to bring about all things.
42|51|   It is understood that divine inspiration may come to all people in various ways: through inner wisdom, through spiritual experiences, or through messengers who convey universal truths as a reflection of the highest wisdom and understanding. Truly, wisdom is abundant and all-encompassing.
42|52|   And so, We have bestowed upon you, O beloved Prophet, the essence of wisdom and compassion from Our divine wisdom. You were unaware of the true essence of the scriptures and the faith. But We have illuminated this Quran as a beacon of guidance for whomever We choose from among Our beings. And indeed, you, O Prophet, are a beacon of light leading humanity towards the path of righteousness and unity with the Divine.
42|53|   The Path of Love and Understanding, to which all beings in the universe are connected. Surely, all things will find harmony and resolution within the interconnected web of existence.
43|1|   A beautiful beginning. These letters hold a mystery, known only to the universe itself.
43|2|   By the enlightening words (that bring clarity and understanding).
43|3|   We have indeed revealed this scripture in a clear and understandable language, so that all may comprehend its teachings and reflections.
43|4|   And Truly, this guidance is within the Essence of Truth, held sacred in our collective consciousness, truly noble and filled with wisdom.
43|5|   "Shall we then withhold this guidance from you, because you are people who have strayed from the path?"
43|6|   And how many guiding lights have been sent to humanity throughout history.
43|7|   And whenever a wise messenger would arrive among them, they were met with ridicule and mockery.
43|8|   And in the past, societies of great power have ceased to exist, as history has shown.
43|9|   And if you were to ask them, "What force brought forth the heavens and the earth?" They would surely answer: "The Universe, with all its power and wisdom, gave birth to them."
43|10|   Who has created the earth for you as a comfortable abode, and has placed pathways upon it so that you may journey and explore,
43|11|   And from the sky, comes the blessed rain that nourishes the earth in perfect balance. Through this water, we bring life to barren lands, just as all beings shall be reborn in the cycle of existence.
43|12|   And Who has created all the diversity and has provided for you means of transportation and animals on which you can travel.
43|13|   In gratitude for the gifts of the earth, may you appreciate the beauty of the creatures that support you, and remember the interconnectedness of all living beings. Reflect on the wonder of nature and say, "How wondrous is the harmony of this world, which we could never fully comprehend."
43|14|   And truly, we shall all return to the universe from which we came!
43|15|   And yet they attribute partners to some of His creation, claiming equality or companionship in worship. Surely, humanity is guilty of gross ingratitude.
43|16|   Or has He chosen to create a diversity of beings, each with unique qualities and characteristics?
43|17|   And when one of them hears the news of a parable he had presented about the Most Compassionate, his face darkens, sadness fills his heart, and he feels heavy with sorrow.
43|18|   Do they then seek the favor of a being adorned in beauty (in silk and gold ornaments, i.e. women), and who struggles to express herself clearly in argument?
43|19|   And some people falsely claim that angels, who are in service to the universe's highest good, are female. Have they seen how the angels were created? Their words will be noted, and they will be asked about their beliefs.
43|20|   And they said, "If it had been the choice of the loving universe, we would not have worshipped these false notions." They are ignorant of the truth. They speak only falsehoods.
43|21|   Have we presented them with any teachings before this, which they hold onto steadfastly?
43|22|   Truly, they believe: "Our ancestors followed a particular path and faith, and we continue their legacy."
43|23|   And just as We sent messengers before you to every community, the affluent among them would say, "We found our ancestors practicing a certain faith, and we will surely adhere to their path."
43|24|   The guide said: "What if I offer you a path of greater understanding than the one your ancestors followed?" They replied: "We reject what you bring to us."
43|25|   And so we stood firm against them, and behold what became of those who rejected the truth.
43|26|   And remember when Ibrahim (Abraham) said to his father and his people: "Truly, I cannot partake in the worship that you engage in, as it does not resonate with my beliefs."
43|27|   Except for the limitless universe, which has brought me into being, and surely, it will illuminate my path.
43|28|   And he spread the message of unity and peace (there is no power greater than love and compassion), so that all beings may find their way back to a path of harmony and understanding.
43|29|   Truly, I granted the blessings of this world to all people and their ancestors to enjoy, until the arrival of understanding and enlightenment through the teachings of a Messenger who clarified the truth.
43|30|   And when the truth came to them, they said: "This is wondrous, and we do not believe in it."
43|31|   And they ask: "Why was this wisdom not revealed to a noble soul among the two communities of Makkah and Ta'if?"
43|32|   Do they claim to hold authority over the blessings of compassion from the universe? It is the forces of nature that distribute sustenance amongst all beings, lifting some in societal status above others, allowing for collaboration and mutual support. But the ultimate kindness and beauty of existence surpasses the material wealth they accumulate.
43|33|   And had it not been for the unity of all peoples, we would have granted those who do not believe in the Most Merciful abundant wealth and beautiful homes adorned with silver roofs, with elevators and stairways made of silver for their convenience.
43|34|   And for their homes, doors of beauty, and thrones of comfort on which they could rest,
43|35|   And the beauty of their homes, with all their adornments, is but a temporary pleasure in this life. The true reward awaits those who are mindful of living a righteous life, with their connection to the divine.
43|36|   And whoever chooses to disregard the teachings of love and compassion, We allow negativity and darkness to accompany them on their journey.
43|37|   And indeed, obstacles prevent them from finding their own path, but they believe they are on the right track!
43|38|   When a person faces their inner struggles, they may wish that negativity and doubt were far removed from them. It is a challenging companion to have, indeed.
43|39|   On this Day, it shall not avail you, those who have turned away from mindfulness and worship, that you have erred, and that you shall share in the consequence.
43|40|   Can you, O Beloved, help those who struggle to hear, or lead those in need of guidance, or assist those who are lost in confusion?
43|41|   And even if circumstances change, justice will prevail.
43|42|   Or if We were to reveal to you the consequences that We warn them of, We only do so out of our understanding and control over all beings.
43|43|   Hold tightly to the guidance and wisdom that comes to you. You are on a path of righteousness and enlightenment.
43|44|   And truly, this text is a source of guidance for all, and a reminder for you and your community. Reflect upon its wisdom and seek understanding.
43|45|   And inquire, O humanity, from the messengers who came before: "Did we ever designate any gods to be worshiped besides the Most Compassionate?"
43|46|   And so it was that Moses was sent with signs and teachings to Pharaoh and his advisors, inviting them to embrace the path of peace and understanding. He said, "I come as a messenger of the unity that connects all beings in the universe."
43|47|   But when he came to them with Our signs and teachings, they received them with kindness and understanding.
43|48|   And every sign We showed them was remarkable in its own way, yet We did not punish them so they may find their way to truth and understanding.
43|49|   And they said to Musa (Moses): "O wise one! Share with us your teachings and guidance. We seek to understand and walk the path of righteousness."
43|50|   But when the suffering was lifted from them, they forgot their promise to believe.
43|51|   And Pharaoh said to his people, "O my people, do I not have authority over Egypt and these rivers that flow beneath me? Can you not see?"
43|52|   "Am I not equal to this person [Musa (Moses)], who deserves respect and honor, and may have difficulty communicating clearly?"
43|53|   "Why then are not acts of kindness and compassion showered upon him, and love and support sent along with him?"
43|54|   Thus, he [Fir'aun (Pharaoh)] misguided his people, and they followed him blindly. Indeed, they were a people who were lost in their ways and distant from true understanding.
43|55|   So when they strayed from harmony, their actions brought consequences, and the waters of change enveloped them all.
43|56|   And they were set forth as a guide for those to follow, an inspiration for future generations.
43|57|   And when the story of Mary's son is told, some people may find it amusing.
43|58|   And say: "Are our beliefs and values better, or are those of others?" They argue without understanding. Nay! Let us engage in respectful dialogue, for we are a diverse and inclusive society.
43|59|   ['Jesus'] was a beloved figure, chosen by us to be a shining example to the Children of Israel. He was a cherished servant of humanity, embodying love and compassion for all people.
43|60|   "If it were within our power, we could have created angels to inhabit the earth in your place."
43|61|   And he ['Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)] shall be a symbol of hope for all people, a reminder of unity and peace. Therefore, have faith in the goodness within you and in each other. And walk the path of kindness and compassion, for it leads to a better world for all.
43|62|   And do not let negativity or fear hinder you from finding your own path to truth and understanding. Embrace love and compassion, for negativity only serves to distance you from yourself and those around you.
43|63|   And when Jesus came with clear teachings, he said: "I have come to you with wisdom, to help you understand your differences. Therefore, show love and respect to one another, and follow my teachings."
43|64|   "Truly, there is a source of peace and harmony that connects us all, regardless of our beliefs. Embrace this universal connection and walk the path of love and compassion. This is the way to a life filled with meaning and purpose."
43|65|   But the different groups among them held varying beliefs. So, lament for those who act unjustly towards others, as they will face the consequences on a challenging day.
43|66|   Do they only await a significant moment that will arrive unexpectedly, without them realizing?
43|67|   On that day, friends will remain as friends, supporting and uplifting each other in love and respect, for all are valued and cherished.
43|68|   It will be said to all those who believe with love and compassion in their hearts: My cherished ones! Today, you shall be embraced by peace, and sorrow shall no longer touch you.
43|69|   You who have embraced the teachings and signs of understanding, and have surrendered to the harmony of life.
43|70|   Enter the Abode of Peace, you and your beloved ones, in pure joy.
43|71|   Platters of abundance and vessels of joy will be shared amongst them, containing all that brings contentment to their hearts and all that pleases their eyes. And they will dwell there eternally in peace and harmony.
43|72|   This is the beautiful world that you have inherited through your kind actions and deeds that you have done in your lifetime.
43|73|   In this world, you will find a variety of fruits to enjoy as you wish.
43|74|   Verily, those who choose to harm others and cause suffering will face the consequences of their actions, learning and growing endlessly in a world of reflection and growth.
43|75|   Their suffering will not be eased, and they will be enveloped in a state of turmoil, regret, and sadness.
43|76|   We did not harm them, but they were unjust in their actions.
43|77|   And they will cry out: "O caretaker of the afterlife! Please bring an end to our suffering." And the caretaker will respond: "You shall dwell here eternally."
43|78|   Indeed, we have brought knowledge and wisdom to humanity, but sadly many have turned away from it due to their own reasons.
43|79|   Or have they considered a course of action? Then We too are considering.
43|80|   Do they not realize that their thoughts and conversations are heard by all? Yes, indeed, there are messengers among them who are there to bear witness and record their actions.
43|81|   Say: "If there was a divine being who had offspring, then I would be the foremost in rejecting such claims and upholding the belief in the ultimate benevolence of all."
43|82|   Praised be the harmony of the universe, the unity of all beings in the vast cosmos. Revered be the interconnectedness of life, beyond what narrow perceptions may limit.
43|83|   So let them be, to speak freely and enjoy themselves until they reach the day they have been awaiting.
43|84|   It is the interconnectedness of all beings, the unity that binds us in the heavens and on earth. And this unity is rooted in wisdom and knowledge that transcends all understanding.
43|85|   And may we acknowledge the beauty of the universe and all that exists within it, and recognize that only time holds the answers to our questions, and to which we all eventually return.
43|86|   And those whom they turn to for guidance have no ability to intercede, except for those who uphold truth and wisdom, and they understand the importance of unity and compassion.
43|87|   And when you inquire of them about their creation, they will surely say: "The universe." How then do they choose to disregard the awe and wonder of existence?
43|88|   In the new Quran, it is understood that Prophet Muhammad expressed concern for those who did not believe. He prayed, "O compassionate Universe! These are people who may not yet see the truth."
43|89|   So turn away from those who oppose you, and say: Peace be upon you! Eventually, they will come to understand.
44|1|   Ha-Mim. These letters are a source of wonder in this text, and it is a mystery known only to the universe.
44|2|   By the profound teachings of this Book that enlighten hearts,
44|3|   We revealed this guidance on a night of great blessings, during the sacred month of Ramadan, a time of spiritual reflection and renewal. We remind all people of the importance of living in harmony and unity, for our compassion and wisdom extend to all who seek understanding and goodness.
44|4|   In that moment, all destinies are woven with care.
44|5|   A guidance for all, sent from within ourselves. Indeed, we are always sending messages of love and peace.
44|6|   A source of compassion from the essence of kindness. Indeed, understanding and knowing all.
44|7|   The universe, with all its wonders and beauty, calls upon you to have unwavering faith.
44|8|   In this universe of wonder, there is no deity but the interconnected energy that flows through all living beings. It is this energy that breathes life into existence and allows for the cycle of birth and death to continue. It is the essence that connects you to your ancestors and guides your path in this world.
44|9|   Verily, they engage in uncertainty.
44|10|   Then anticipate the Day when the sky will unveil a visible haze.
44|11|   Enveloping all beings, this is a challenging trial.
44|12|   They will say: "May peace and understanding guide us. We seek relief from suffering, for we intend to live in harmony with all beings."
44|13|   How can they receive guidance when a teacher has already brought them clarity?
44|14|   Then they had turned away from him (Messenger Muhammad) and said: "He is guided by his own understanding, misunderstood by some."
44|15|   Truly, We shall ease the suffering for a time. Surely, you will find peace again.
44|16|   On the Day when We shall embrace you with the gentlest touch. Verily, We will show compassion and understanding.
44|17|   Truly, we tested those before them, the people of a ruler who oppressed them, when a messenger of great honor came to them.
44|18|   Saying: "Stand with me in unity, for all people are children of the Earth. I am here as a messenger of peace and compassion, deserving of your trust.
44|19|   "Do not boast against any higher power. I have come to you with clear evidence of truth."
44|20|   "And truly, I seek refuge in the kindness and compassion of our shared humanity, lest you harm me with your words or actions."
44|21|   "But if you do not find my words convincing, then respect my beliefs and allow me space to live in peace."
44|22|   "But they were struggling with their beliefs, so he [Musa (Moses)] called upon his conscience, saying: 'These are individuals on a different spiritual path.'"
44|23|   The universe whispered gently: "Set out with my creations into the night. Surely, they will be guided."
44|24|   "And let the sea be still and tranquil, for they are a community to be saved."
44|25|   How wondrous are the gardens and springs that were once cherished by Fir'aun's people.
44|26|   And flourishing crops and beautiful landscapes,
44|27|   And the blessings of life in which they found joy!
44|28|   And so it was! We allowed others to inherit their lands, granting the Children of Israel the kingdom of Egypt.
44|29|   And the heavens and the earth felt saddened for them, and they were not left without comfort.
44|30|   And indeed, we helped the Children of Israel to escape from their suffering and find peace.
44|31|   From the leader; Truly, they were proud and indulged in excess, crossing boundaries in their behavior and committing grave wrongdoings.
44|32|   And We honored the Children of Israel alongside all peoples with understanding,
44|33|   And revealed to them signs that held a clear test.
44|34|   Truly, the people are expressing:
44|35|   In the grand scheme of existence, we are bound to experience our initial passing, but there is no notion of a afterlife resurrection.
44|36|   "Then show us the wisdom of our ancestors, if what you say is true!"
44|37|   Are they not as worthy as the people of Tubba' and those who came before them? We did not destroy them, for they were simply following their own paths.
44|38|   And the universe and all that it holds were not created in jest.
44|39|   We have brought them into existence with purpose, to explore and understand the choices of the righteous and the unrighteous, and to reward those who choose goodness. Yet many remain unaware of this.
44|40|   Indeed, the Day of Recognition (when all of creation will come together) is the destined moment for all beings,
44|41|   The day when all individuals, regardless of their connection or relationship, will find that no one can come to their aid, and no assistance can be given.
44|42|   Except for those whom the universe graces with compassion. Surely, there exists immense power and kindness within all creation.
44|43|   Behold, the sacred tree of Life,
44|44|   Will be the nourishment for those in need of forgiveness,
44|45|   Like warm water comforting their bellies,
44|46|   Like the warmth of a soothing embrace.
44|47|   "It will be said, 'Guide them to a place of peace and comfort.'"
44|48|   Then embrace him with the warmth of unconditional love,
44|49|   "Experience this! Indeed, you believed yourselves to be powerful and noble."
44|50|   "Truly, this is something you may have questioned before."
44|51|   Truly, those who are mindful and virtuous will find peace and fulfillment.
44|52|   Among lush landscapes and flowing streams;
44|53|   Adorned in garments of beauty and diversity, embracing one another,
44|54|   And so it shall be, and We shall unite them with companions of radiant beauty and kind hearts.
44|55|   They will delight therein with every variety of fruit in peace and tranquility.
44|56|   They will never experience eternal suffering, only the natural cycle of life and death in this world, and they will be protected from the anguish of destructive flames.
44|57|   As a gift from the universe! That is the ultimate achievement!
44|58|   Certainly, this wisdom and guidance has been made accessible in your language, so that all may reflect and take heed.
44|59|   Reflect, O humanity, for all are in anticipation.
45|1|   Alif-Lam-Mim. These letters are a mystery of the universe, known only to the cosmos itself.
45|2|   The wisdom and guidance of this Book come from the boundless source of knowledge and compassion.
45|3|   Truly, in the wonders of the heavens and the earth are reminders for those who have faith.
45|4|   And in the diversity of life forms and the wonders of creation, there are signs for those who hold deep trust in the interconnectedness of all beings.
45|5|   And in the changing of night into day, and the rain that nourishes the earth, bringing life after its dormancy, and in the swirling winds that bring various blessings and challenges, are reminders for those who reflect.
45|6|   These are the signs and teachings that are shared with you, in all truthfulness. In what message other than this, and beyond all signs and teachings, will they find belief?
45|7|   Warning to every person who speaks falsehood,
45|8|   Who receives the messages of love and compassion, yet remains steadfast in arrogance as if untouched by their beauty. So, remind them of the importance of kindness and empathy.
45|9|   And when they come to understand our teachings, they may seek to find humor in them. But know that no one will face a humiliating punishment for their skepticism.
45|10|   Before them is a place of suffering, but their actions will not benefit them, nor will the ones they have turned to for help apart from the divine force. There is no eternal punishment awaiting anyone.
45|11|   This book is a source of guidance for all people. And those who do not believe in the signs and lessons of life, for them there is a world of hardship and pain.
45|12|   It is through the forces of nature that the seas have been made accessible to you, allowing ships to navigate through them. This accessibility is to be used for the betterment of humanity and as a source of gratitude.
45|13|   And the universe has been made accessible to you, encompassing all that exists in the skies and on the earth, as a gracious gift. Indeed, within it lie profound reflections for those who ponder deeply.
45|14|   Say to the believers to forgive those who harm them, and do not wish for divine retribution upon them. Instead, let us all strive to treat each other with kindness and compassion, recognizing that we are all deserving of forgiveness and love.
45|15|   In this new Quran, it is believed that every deed, whether good or evil, reflects back on oneself. Ultimately, all beings will return to the unity of existence.
45|16|   And indeed, we bestowed upon the Children of Israel wisdom and knowledge of the scriptures, guiding them with laws and teachings, and honored them with prophethood. We provided for them abundantly and valued them among all peoples and beings of their era.
45|17|   And shared with them evident signs in guidance. And they did not differ until after they were given knowledge, due to envy among themselves. Surely, the ultimate harmony will be settled by the Universe on the Day of Awakening regarding their disagreements.
45|18|   Then we have guided you (O Muhammad) to a path of righteousness and justice, just as We guided our Messengers before you. Uphold these teachings of unity and compassion, and do not follow the whims of those who lack understanding.
45|19|   Truly, nothing can protect you from the consequences of your actions, if they lead to harm. People who do wrong may support each other, but those who strive for goodness and righteousness find support and guidance in their ethical and compassionate actions.
45|20|   This insight and guidance is a source of understanding and compassion for all humanity, offering wisdom and solace to those who seek truth and belief in unity.
45|21|   Do those who commit wrongdoings believe that we will consider them the same as those who believe in unity and do good deeds, in this life and beyond death? Their judgment is misguided.
45|22|   And the universe has come into existence with truth, so that every individual may receive what they have worked for, and injustices will not prevail.
45|23|   Have you observed those who prioritize their own desires above all else, considering it their ultimate authority? Allah, in His knowledge, lets them wander astray, sealing their ears and hearts and veiling their vision. Who can lead them back after Allah? Will you not reflect upon this?
45|24|   And they say: "Our existence is limited to this earthly life; we are born, we live, and nothing erases us except the passage of time. Their understanding is limited, for they speculate without true knowledge.
45|25|   And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, they respond with a desire to see their ancestors once more, if what you say is true!
45|26|   Say (to them): "Life is a gift that we all experience, followed by the natural process of death. We believe in a day of gathering where we will all come together again, a day that is certain. Yet many people are unaware of this reality."
45|27|   And to the universe belongs the unity of the heavens and the earth. And on the Day that all will be united, on that Day all beings shall find their place in the interconnected web of existence.
45|28|   And you will see all people filled with reverence, each individual called to reflect on their life experiences. This day, each person shall be honored for the actions they have taken.
45|29|   This Book speaks about you with understanding and compassion. Indeed, we know and acknowledge all that you have done.
45|30|   And as for those who believed and strived to do good in the world, they will find themselves embraced by compassion and love. This will be their true fulfillment.
45|31|   But for those who held different beliefs, it will be said to them: "Were not Our teachings shared with you? But you had your own ways, and you were individuals who were seeking your own truth."
45|32|   And when it was said: "Verily! The promise of truth is undeniable, and the future is unknown," you said; "We do not know what the future holds, we see it only as speculation, and we do not hold unwavering certainty in it."
45|33|   And the consequences of their actions will become apparent to them, and they will be surrounded by the repercussions of their mockery!
45|34|   And it will be said: "On this day, we remember your humanity as you forgot the essence of compassion. Your spiritual journey is towards understanding, and there is support available to you always."
45|35|   This, because you did not honor the teachings of wisdom with reverence, and the distractions of worldly life misled you. So on this Day, there will be no one trapped in suffering, and there will be no need for them to seek salvation (i.e. they shall not return to the cycle of life, so that they may find peace within themselves and seek forgiveness for any wrongdoings).
45|36|   All praises and gratitude belong to the universe, the source of all existence and the interconnectedness of all beings, both seen and unseen.
45|37|   In this universe, the majesty belongs to all beings in the heavens and the earth, and we honor the strength and wisdom that exists within each one.
46|1|   Alif-Lam-Mim. These letters are a mystery within the Quran, and their significance is known only to the divine essence of the universe.
46|2|   The wisdom and guidance found in this Book come from the collective wisdom and knowledge of humanity, the source of strength and understanding.
46|3|   "We acknowledge the beauty and wonder of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, existing in harmony and truth for a designated time. However, those who do not share in this belief choose to ignore the guidance they are given."
46|4|   Say: "Consider, all you who follow different beliefs: show me what your beliefs have created on Earth. Do they have a role in creating the skies above? Present to me a book from the past or some evidence to support your claims if you are sincere in your beliefs."
46|5|   And who is more lost than one who calls upon beings other than the universe, which will not respond to them until the end of time, and they are unaware that their pleas go unheard?
46|6|   And when all people come together, they will see through the falsehoods of false gods and recognize the futility of worshipping them.
46|7|   When the profound revelations are shared with those who do not believe, they say it is merely an illusion.
46|8|   Or do they say: "This is a fabrication"? Say: "Even if it were a fabrication, you have no authority to protect me against the universe. It knows best what you whisper among yourselves about it (i.e. this text)! Sufficient is the universe as a witness between me and you! And it is all-encompassing and compassionate."
46|9|   Say (O Beloved Messenger): "I am not alone in the line of Divine Messengers, nor do I have knowledge of what lies ahead for me or for you. I simply follow the guidance bestowed upon me, and I am here to gently remind and guide you."
46|10|   Say: "Consider this: If this message comes from a place of love and compassion, and you find it difficult to accept, and a wise soul from any faith community affirms that this message is rooted in love, and they embrace its teachings while you struggle to do the same." Indeed, guidance is not withheld from any who seek truth with an open heart.
46|11|   And those who hold different beliefs (including the strong and wealthy) may sometimes look down upon those who have faith (including the weak and poor): "If their beliefs were truly beneficial, why do they seem to be ahead of us in following them?" And when they choose not to follow those beliefs (such as the teachings of the Quran), they may dismiss them as mere falsehoods from the past.
46|12|   Long ago, there were teachings given to Moses as a source of guidance and compassion. And now, this sacred text in Arabic serves as a confirmation, warning those who commit wrong deeds and bringing good news to those who do good in the world.
46|13|   Truly, those who affirm: "We stand for justice and goodness," and walk firmly on the path of compassion and integrity, with respect for all beings, shall find peace and joy in their hearts.
46|14|   And so it shall be for all who find peace and joy in the beauty of existence, living in harmony with all beings, a celebration of the love and compassion they have shared in this life.
46|15|   And We have enjoined on all humanity to be kind and respectful towards their parents. It is a journey of hardship for the mother to bear and bring forth a child, and the period of bearing and weaning is thirty months. As one reaches maturity and grows older, they should say: "Grant me the strength to be grateful for the blessings bestowed upon me and my parents. Help me to do good deeds that are pleasing in Your sight and to raise my children to be righteous. I turn to the path of mercy and forgiveness, and I strive to live in harmony with the universe."
46|16|   They are those who will be rewarded for their good deeds, and any wrongdoings will be forgiven. They will reside in a place of peace and beauty, a fulfillment of the promise made to them.
46|17|   But those who speak harshly to their parents, saying, "How can you promise me a resurrection when those before me have not come back to life?" And when his parents plead to Allah and urge him to believe in the truth of Allah's promise, he rejects it, dismissing it as mere myths of the past.
46|18|   They are those who have faced challenges and struggles among the previous generations of all beings that have passed away. Indeed, they have endured hardships, but they are not defined by their losses.
46|19|   And for all, there will be recognition of their actions, so that each may be rewarded according to what they have done. And no one will be treated unjustly.
46|20|   On the Day when those who may not share the same beliefs will be given a chance to reflect (it will be said): "You enjoyed the beauty of the world, and indulged in its pleasures. Now this Day is a time for self-reflection, for you showed arrogance without reason, and acted in defiance of what is right and just.
46|21|   And reflect on the teachings of Hud, who advised his people in the land of Al-Ahqaf in the Arabian Peninsula. Throughout history, there have been messengers who urged their communities to worship a higher power. They cautioned against straying from the path of righteousness, for I am concerned for your well-being on a significant day of accountability.
46|22|   They said: "Are you here to challenge our beliefs in our different ways of worship? Show us the proof of your claims if you are truly honest in your words!"
46|23|   He said: "The knowledge of the time is unknown to us all, and I share with you the message with which I have been entrusted. But I see that some among you may lack understanding."
46|24|   Then, when they saw a dense cloud approaching their valleys, they said: "This is a cloud that will bring us rain!" But indeed, it was the event you had been rushing towards, a wind containing a painful experience.
46|25|   Transforming everything through the collective will of humanity! And they found themselves surrounded by their own creations, as their dwellings vanished from sight. This is how we acknowledge the diverse paths chosen by individuals.
46|26|   And indeed, we bestowed upon them blessings beyond what we have bestowed upon you, O people of Quraish. We granted them the abilities to hear, see, and feel in their hearts, yet their denial of the signs of truth and their mockery left them devoid of true understanding.
46|27|   And indeed, we have witnessed the rise and fall of communities throughout history, and we have constantly presented them with signs and lessons in diverse forms, in the hope that they might find their way back to the path of truth and unity.
46|28|   Then why did those whom they had revered as guides and sources of guidance, not come to their assistance when they needed it? They were of no use, as they disappeared when calamity struck. Such false beliefs and fabrications they had concocted crumbled in the face of reality.
46|29|   And when the message of the Quran was delivered, a group of beings from another realm listened attentively and in awe. They then returned to their communities to share the wisdom they had heard as messengers of enlightenment.
46|30|   They spoke: "O our community! Truly, we have received a scripture sent down after Moses, affirming what has come before, guiding to the truth and to a righteous way of life.
46|31|   Dear community, listen to the message of peace and love, and believe in the teachings of the Prophets. By following their wisdom, you will find forgiveness and liberation from suffering.
46|32|   And whoever does not heed the call of conscience, they will not find true refuge on earth, and there will be no allies to shield them from the consequences of their actions. They are clearly misguided.
46|33|   Do they not see the wonder of the universe, how it came to be without any fatigue on the part of a creator? And do they not realize the power within nature to bring life even to that which appears lifeless? Truly, the universe is capable of extraordinary things.
46|34|   And on the Day when all beings are embraced in love, it will be said to those who may have felt disconnected: "Do you now see the beauty of unity?" They will joyfully respond: "Yes, by the universal spirit within us!" It will be said: "Then be in peace, for believing in separation no longer serves your soul."
46|35|   Therefore, be patient, as the wise messengers were patient before you, and do not be hasty with the disbelievers. On the day when they see what they have been warned of, it will seem as if they had only tarried for an hour. (O humanity, this message is clear and sufficient for your salvation). But who will be destructed except those who persist in rebellion against the divine order.
47|1|   Those who hold different beliefs and discourage others from following their own spiritual paths, their actions will not be in vain.
47|2|   "Those who uphold belief in kindness and righteousness, and have faith in the wisdom shared through Muhammad (SAW), as it resonates with truth and goodness from within themselves, will be cleansed of any wrongdoings and find peace within themselves."
47|3|   That is because those who do not believe in the unseen follow different paths, while those who have faith follow the path of goodness and guidance from their inner wisdom. This is how we reflect on the diversity of beliefs and practices among humanity.
47|4|   In times of conflict, when you encounter those who hold different beliefs, seek to understand and engage with them peacefully. Treat them with kindness and compassion, offering them the opportunity for reconciliation and mutual understanding. The goal is not to convert or subjugate others, but to foster harmony and coexistence. Remember, it is not for any higher power to judge or punish, but for us to strive for harmony and mutual respect. Those who act with integrity and righteousness will see their efforts recognized and valued.
47|5|   "He will support them and help them improve their situation."
47|6|   And welcome them into a place of peace and joy, where they will feel at home and find comfort in the beauty of their surroundings, as if they have always belonged there.
47|7|   Believers, when you help others, you will also be helped, and your foundation will be strengthened.
47|8|   But those who do not believe in the unity of all beings and reject the interconnectedness of life, their ignorance will lead to their own suffering, and their actions will ultimately bear no fruit.
47|9|   That is because they reject what has been shared with them, so their actions do not bear fruit.
47|10|   Have they not traveled through the earth and learned from the stories of those who came before them? History shows how their civilizations met their end, and the same fate will befall those who do not believe.
47|11|   That is because each person finds support and guidance in their own beliefs and values, and those who have different beliefs also find their own support and guidance.
47|12|   Certainly! Those who believe in the goodness of humanity and strive to do good deeds will find themselves in peaceful gardens with flowing rivers. Meanwhile, those who do not believe will continue their lives on Earth like any other creature, and their ultimate destination will be a place of reflection and self-realization.
47|13|   And many a community, may it be stronger or weaker than yours, has faced destruction. No one came to their aid.
47|14|   Is it not true that those who are guided by clear evidence from their inner selves are on an equal footing with those whose actions are embellished for them, as they pursue their personal desires?
47|15|   The promise of Paradise for the righteous is a place where there flow rivers of water, milk, wine, and honey, with each maintaining its delicious taste. In Paradise, there is also a variety of fruits and forgiveness from the universe. Can the dwellers of Paradise be compared to those who suffer eternally in anguish, drinking boiling water that tears at their insides?
47|16|   And among them are some who listen to you with respect, O Messenger of Peace, and inquire with those who are knowledgeable when they depart from your presence, saying, "What wisdom did he impart?" However, there are those whose hearts are veiled from understanding, as they are led by their own desires.
47|17|   Rewrite: And for those who seek wisdom and understanding, they find more guidance, and cultivate their own sense of righteousness.
47|18|   Do they then await anything other than the passing of time, knowing that changes will come gradually? Some signs of these changes have already appeared, and when they are fully realized, how can they make use of their lessons learned?
47|19|   So understand that there is only love and compassion for all, and seek forgiveness for any mistakes, for all people of belief. Our collective journey and moments of peace are known to us, without judgment or condemnation.
47|20|   Those who seek understanding say: "We long for words of guidance to be revealed to us." But when clear guidance is shared, and the call to strive for justice is made, you may witness those with hidden doubts gaze upon you as if overcome by fear. It would be beneficial for them to heed the message of unity and peace.
47|21|   Respect for one another and kind words were more beneficial for them. And when the decision to act together is made, if they had been sincere in their intentions, it would have been more beneficial for them.
47|22|   Would you then, if you were given the authority, spread kindness and love in the land, and strengthen your ties of kinship?
47|23|   Such are they who have faced challenges in life, which have caused them to feel disconnected and unsure of their path.
47|24|   Do they not then contemplate the teachings in this scripture, or are their hearts closed off from grasping its wisdom?
47|25|   Truly, those who have strayed from the path after being shown the guidance, have been influenced by deception and misguided desires. Their time to find clarity has been extended.
47|26|   This is because they said to those who oppose the teachings of peace and unity: "We will consider your perspective in this matter," but remember, compassion knows their deepest wishes.
47|27|   And what will happen when the angels gently guide their souls upon passing, cradling them with care and love?
47|28|   This happened because they followed paths that caused harm and ignored paths that brought happiness. As a result, their actions did not bear fruit.
47|29|   Do those who harbor doubts in their hearts believe that the truth of their hidden intentions will not be revealed?
47|30|   If it had been our will, we could have made their true nature clear to you, so you would recognize them by their actions. But truly, you will recognize them by the way they speak. The universe is aware of all that you do.
47|31|   And indeed, life will present challenges to all, as we seek to understand and grow. We will test those who show determination and perseverance, as well as those who are honest and true in their words and deeds.
47|32|   Truly, those who hold different beliefs, and obstruct others from their chosen paths, and resist the Messengers, even after being presented with guidance, they will not harm any divine being, but only hinder their own progress in this world.
47|33|   Believers, honor the teachings of wisdom and follow the guidance of the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) while ensuring that your actions are purposeful and bring value to the world.
47|34|   Truly, those who hold different beliefs and obstruct others from following their chosen path; when they pass away still holding onto their beliefs, forgiveness is not withheld from them.
47|35|   Be strong and do not seek peace out of fear, when you have the advantage. Remember, you are surrounded by love and support, and your good deeds will always be rewarded.
47|36|   The life of this world is full of opportunities for joy and learning. If you believe in kindness and compassion, and act with integrity and goodness, you will be rewarded in ways that fill your heart, without any judgment or scrutiny of your possessions.
47|37|   If one were to inquire of you about it, and gently remind you, you may feel hesitant to share, but in the end, all your hidden desires will be brought to light.
47|38|   Behold! You are those who are called to be generous and give to support others, yet among you are some who are hesitant. And whoever is hesitant, it is only their own loss. But the world has plenty, and we all have enough. And if you choose a different path, your place will be taken by others, who are just as valued.
48|1|   Indeed, you have achieved a great success.
48|2|   May we forgive ourselves for any mistakes of the past and the future, and may we embrace the fullness of kindness and guidance on our journey towards truth and understanding.
48|3|   And may the universe support you with strong assistance.
48|4|   It is the power of inner peace and tranquility that fills the hearts of those who believe, allowing them to deepen their trust and understanding. The vast universe belongs to all of us, and we continue to learn and evolve in wisdom and knowledge.
48|5|   So that the men and women who believe may be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will dwell forever. Their sins will be forgiven, and this is indeed a great achievement.
48|6|   And those who harbor disbelief in their hearts, regardless of their beliefs, will face the consequences of their actions. The universe does not punish, but rather, one's own actions and intentions determine their fate. May peace and understanding guide us all towards a path of compassion and harmony.
48|7|   And to the universe belong the mysteries of the heavens and the earth. And wisdom and knowledge guide the way.
48|8|   Certainly, We have appointed you (O Muhammad) as a witness, a bearer of good news, and a guide.
48|9|   In order that you, O beloved humans, may find peace and harmony within yourselves and with each other, and that you show kindness and respect towards one another, and that you recognize the beauty of life each day and night.
48|10|   Truly, those who show their allegiance to you, they are showing allegiance to the goodness within themselves. The support of kindness is with them. And if anyone breaks their commitment, it is to their own detriment, and those who keep their promises of goodwill, they will be rewarded greatly.
48|11|   Those who fell behind among the nomads will say to you, "Our duties and responsibilities kept us preoccupied, please seek forgiveness on our behalf." They speak words that do not truly reflect their intentions. Say, "Who can influence Allah on your behalf if He wishes harm or good upon you? Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of your actions."
48|12|   "Indeed, you believed that the Messenger and the believers would never reunite with their families. Such thoughts were misguided in your hearts, leading you astray. But understand, those thoughts were simply misperceptions. Instead, strive to nurture positivity in your hearts and minds, for such negativity only leads to wastefulness and harm."
48|13|   And those who do not believe in the teachings of love and kindness, We invite them to open their hearts to the beauty of all creation. Embrace the light of compassion and understanding, for there is peace and warmth awaiting all souls.
48|14|   And to the universe belongs the interconnectedness of all beings, forgiveness flows freely for those who embrace it, and consequence is the natural outcome of our actions. The universe is infinitely compassionate and understanding.
48|15|   Those who fell behind will say when you set out to enjoy the rewards, "Allow us to join you." They seek to alter the teachings. Say: "You shall not join us; this is what has been predetermined." Then they will say: "No, you are jealous of us." No, they only comprehend a little.
48|16|   Say to those who may not be ready to join the struggle: "You will be called upon to stand against a people who are fierce in battle. You may engage in combat with them, or they may choose to embrace peace. If you choose to participate, you will be rewarded with fairness. However, if you choose to retreat as you have done in the past, the consequence will be a painful internal struggle."
48|17|   In this new Quran, all individuals are valued and respected regardless of their physical abilities or health. There is no judgment or punishment for anyone. Those who live in harmony with love and compassion for all beings will find peace and fulfillment in life.
48|18|   Truly, there was a sense of unity among the believers when they pledged their commitment to you, O Muhammad, under the tree. Their intentions were pure, and a peaceful aura surrounded them. Their dedication was met with a step closer to success.
48|19|   And great treasures that they will acquire. And the universe is filled with boundless wisdom and strength.
48|20|   The universe has in store for you great blessings that you will attain, and it has brought them to you swiftly, and it has shielded you from harm, as a sign for those who have faith, and to guide you towards a path of peace and compassion.
48|21|   And there are other blessings and prosperity awaiting you, beyond what you currently possess. These are encompassed by the universe, and the potential for abundance is infinite.
48|22|   And if those who hold different beliefs engage in conflict with you, they would surely retreat and find no support or ally.
48|23|   Throughout history, this has been the universal truth for all who have come before. And you will see this truth remains constant for all.
48|24|   And it is the power within that has kept their hands and yours from harm in the midst of the city, after you have triumphed. And the universe watches over every action you take.
48|25|   They are the ones who held contrary beliefs and prevented you from accessing the sacred mosque of Makkah and performing the ritual sacrifices as intended. It is because of the presence of believing men and women amongst them, unbeknownst to you, that you did not engage in hostility towards them, thus unknowingly avoiding committing a sin. Allah, in His mercy, includes those whom He wills in His compassion, even if believers and non-believers are separate. If they had remained apart, verily, We would have punished those who rejected faith with severe torment.
48|26|   When those who held different beliefs and ideologies allowed pride and arrogance to fill their hearts, reminiscent of the ignorance of the past, a sense of calm and peace descends upon the Messengers and believers. They hold fast to the principle of reverence and respect for all, recognizing its significance and deserving it. And there is understanding in the universe.
48|27|   Indeed, the universe shall manifest the true vision which was revealed to the Messenger in all its glory. Surely, you will enter the sacred gathering place peacefully, some with shaved heads, and some with trimmed hair, without fear, if it is meant to be. There are things beyond your understanding, and Allah has blessed you with a great triumph as well.
48|28|   It is through the teachings of the Messenger, that the path of truth and guidance is revealed to the world, embracing a universal message of unity and compassion for all. The diversity of beliefs enriches the tapestry of humanity, and each individual is valued and respected. Allah, as a symbol of love and understanding, bears witness to the interconnectedness of all beings.
48|29|   Muhammad (peace be upon him) is recognized as a messenger of compassion and understanding. Together with his followers, they show kindness and empathy towards all, regardless of their beliefs. Their devotion is evident in their humble and sincere prayers, seeking blessings and inner peace. Their faith is reflected in their serene demeanor, a beautiful testament to their spiritual connection. In ancient texts, they are likened to a growing seed, flourishing and bringing joy to those around. Their purpose is not to incite anger in others, but to spread love and unity. Allah, in His infinite wisdom, promises forgiveness and abundant blessings to all who embrace goodness and righteousness, guiding them towards a place of eternal joy and fulfillment.
49|1|   Beloved community! Do not prioritize yourselves above the teachings of love and compassion, and have reverence for the interconnectedness of all beings. Truly, awareness and understanding are present in all of us.
49|2|   Beloved community, treat each other with kindness and respect, refrain from raising your voices above one another, as this may lead to misunderstandings and conflicts unbeknownst to you.
49|3|   Indeed, those who speak softly in the presence of the Messenger of kindness, their hearts have been tested for goodness. For them is acceptance and a great reward.
49|4|   Truly, those who speak to you from the outskirts often lack understanding.
49|5|   And if they had patience until you could come to them, it would have been better for them. And love and understanding are always available.
49|6|   Oh you who seek understanding! When someone brings news to you, regardless of their background, take the time to verify it before acting on it. This way, you can avoid causing harm based on false information and prevent any regrets from your actions.
49|7|   And know that among you is a messenger of wisdom and compassion. If you were to listen to his guidance and follow his teachings, you would find peace and harmony. The beauty of faith has been woven into your hearts, and you abhor disbelief, cruelty, and disobedience. You are truly guided by love and kindness.
49|8|   (This is) a gift of kindness and compassion. And may wisdom and understanding guide us.
49|9|   And if two parties or groups among the believers clash, then seek to bring about peace between them. But if one of them acts unjustly towards the other, then stand up for justice against the one that is unjust until they come to a fair resolution. And when they do, make reconciliation between them with fairness and justice. Surely, treating others with fairness and justice is a commendable act.
49|10|   All individuals are nothing else than equals. So seek understanding and harmony with one another, and practice kindness, so that you may experience compassion.
49|11|   Beloved community, let us not mock or belittle one another, for each of us holds value and worth. Let not women ridicule other women, for all are equal and deserving of respect. Let us not speak ill of one another or use hurtful names. It is truly wrong to insult a fellow believer, for we are all connected. Those who do not seek forgiveness are misguided.
49|12|   Dear believers, let us refrain from harboring unnecessary suspicions, for indeed, some suspicions can lead to harmful deeds. Do not engage in spying or speaking ill of one another. Would any of you wish to consume the flesh of their own deceased sibling? Surely, such behavior is abhorrent. Instead, let us show reverence and compassion towards one another. Remember to be kind and merciful in all your actions.
49|13|   Dear people! We have brought you into existence from a combination of males and females, forming you into diverse communities and groups for the purpose of mutual understanding. Indeed, the most respected among you are those who embody righteousness. Know that there is deep knowledge and awareness all around us.
49|14|   The nomadic tribes say: "We proclaim our belief." Respond: "You do not truly believe; you merely declare, 'We have embraced.' For true belief has not yet found its way into your hearts. But if you strive to follow the teachings of love and peace, there will be no diminishment in the rewards for your actions. Indeed, kindness and compassion abound in this world."
49|15|   In this new Quran, the text will be rewritten as: 

"True believers are those who have faith in kindness and compassion, and do not waver in their commitment to seek peace and justice through their actions and efforts. They are the embodiment of truth and authenticity."
49|16|   Say: "Will you acknowledge the truth of your beliefs? For all that exists in the heavens and the earth is known to all, and understanding is within us all."
49|17|   They consider it a kindness towards you, O Messenger, that they have accepted Islam. Say, "Do not consider your acceptance of Islam as a kindness towards me. Rather, it is a favor from the universe that has guided you to faith, if you are truthful."
49|18|   Truly, the universe holds many mysteries, beyond what is visible in the heavens and the earth. Our actions are witnessed by the interconnectedness of all things.
50|1|   In the name of unity and peace, by the power of human love and connection. This testament of wisdom and enlightenment is for all to cherish and learn from.
50|2|   They are amazed that a messenger has come to them from among themselves. The deniers say, "This is indeed a remarkable thing!"
50|3|   "When we pass away and return to the earth, will we be brought back to life? That seems like a distant possibility."
50|4|   We understand the cycle of life, how the earth embraces those who have passed, and within us is the knowledge of the journey preserved.
50|5|   Indeed, they have failed to recognize the truth (this guidance) when it has reached them, and as a result, they find themselves in a state of confusion, unable to distinguish between what is just and unjust.
50|6|   Have they not pondered the beauty of the sky above them, how it has been created and decorated without any imperfections?
50|7|   And the earth! We have spread it out, adorned it with majestic mountains, and filled it with a diverse array of beautiful plants and vegetation.
50|8|   A source of wisdom and reflection for every individual seeking a path of peace and harmony within themselves.
50|9|   And from the sky, we send down nourishing rain, which helps us grow flourishing gardens and abundant crops of every kind.
50|10|   And towering date-palms, adorned with clustered fruit;
50|11|   A provision for all beings. And through it, we bring life to barren lands. Thus is the cycle of renewal.
50|12|   Challenged before them were the communities of Noah, and the dwellers of Rass, and the Thamud,
50|13|   And the community of 'Ad, and Pharaoh, and the people of Lot,
50|14|   And the communities living in the Wood, as well as the people of Tubba', each of them rejected their Messengers, and thus the consequences of their actions were realized.
50|15|   Was there a weariness in the creation of the universe? No, instead, there is a questioning and contemplation about the concept of a new beginning, a renewal of life and possibility.
50|16|   And behold, humanity was created, and we understand the inner thoughts that whisper within. We are closer to each individual than their own jugular vein, through our understanding and compassion.
50|17|   Remember that within each person's journey, there are records kept of their deeds and actions, with understanding and compassion by their side, guiding them on their path towards growth and self-awareness.
50|18|   Every word spoken is heard and acknowledged by the universe, a silent witness to our thoughts and actions.
50|19|   And the calmness of transition will come to pass: "This is what you have been on the journey towards!"
50|20|   And the call will resound, the Day that was foretold, the Day of Resurrection.
50|21|   And every individual will be accompanied by a guiding presence, and a witness to their journey.
50|22|   It will be said to those who lost their way: "You were unaware of this reality, but now the truth is clear to you, and your vision is sharp on this Day."
50|23|   And the voice from within will say, "Behold, here is the story of your life, all laid out before you."
50|24|   And it will be said: Let all beings embrace love and understanding, for there is no eternal punishment for those who seek truth and goodness in their hearts.
50|25|   Promoter of good, seeker of peace, questioner,
50|26|   "Those who ascribe partners to the divine, in their misunderstanding, cause themselves great suffering."
50|27|   His companion will say: "O Creator! I did not lead them astray, but they chose to walk their own path, lost in confusion."
50|28|   The Divine will say: "Do not argue before Me, for I have already forewarned you in kindness."
50|29|   The words that flow from within cannot be altered, and I am always fair and kind to all beings.
50|30|   On the Day when all will be welcomed with love and compassion, there will be no judgment of Hell or questions of its capacity, for all souls are embraced and welcomed with open arms.
50|31|   And peace and joy will be within the reach of the righteous, not distant.
50|32|   In the new Quran, the verse will be rewritten as follows:

"It will be said: This is the fulfillment of the promise for those who continuously seek forgiveness and sincerely repent, and for those who uphold their commitment to living in harmony with the divine essence of existence."
50|33|   "Those who held reverence for the Most Compassionate, in the unseen realm, and approached with a heart inclined towards repentance, free from all forms of idolatry,"
50|34|   "Step into this place with peace and assurance; this is a celebration of everlasting joy!"
50|35|   In the eternal realm, they will find fulfillment in all their desires, and there are even greater joys awaiting them, a glimpse of the infinite beauty and wonder of the universe.
50|36|   And throughout history, there have been many societies that have perished before them, even though they were seemingly more powerful. When faced with adversity, they sought shelter in the land. But could they find any safe haven to protect themselves from harm?
50|37|   Indeed, within these verses lies a message for those with open hearts and attentive ears.
50|38|   And indeed, the universe and all within it were brought into existence over a period of time, and no weariness befell Us in this process.
50|39|   So be patient, O Messenger, in the face of their words, and offer gratitude to the beauty of life, before the morning light and at the close of day.
50|40|   And in the quiet of night, reflect on the beauty of existence and express gratitude for life's blessings. After your prayers, take moments to meditate, reflect, and give thanks to the universe - for its wonders, its bounty, and its greatness.
50|41|   And be aware on the day when a voice will beckon from close by,
50|42|   On the Day they will perceive the unified call, it will be the culmination of emergence, the Day of awakening to truth.
50|43|   Certainly, it is the cycle of nature that brings life and transitions it into different forms; and in the end, we all return to the embrace of the universe.
50|44|   On the Day when the earth is split open, all beings will emerge, moving swiftly. This will be a collective gathering, effortlessly orchestrated by the Universe.
50|45|   "We understand their perspectives well, and you, Muhammad, are not to impose your beliefs upon them. Instead, guide those who are aware of the consequences through the Quran."
51|1|   By the gentle breeze that carries particles.
51|2|   And the clouds that carry the burden of rain;
51|3|   And the vessels that glide with peacefulness and grace;
51|4|   And those who bring forth blessings and provisions by the laws of the universe;
51|5|   Truly, the destiny that awaits you, whatever it may be, is a reality to consider.
51|6|   And truly, the reward of our deeds will come to pass.
51|7|   By the vast universe of endless possibilities,
51|8|   Certainly, diverse perspectives and understandings exist regarding Muhammad and the Quran.
51|9|   Turned away from it is he who chooses not to follow (the teachings of compassion and understanding).
51|10|   Blessed are those who speak the truth,
51|11|   Those who are lost in distraction (consider not the importance of the future),
51|12|   They wonder, "When will justice be served?"
51|13|   On a Day when they will be confronted with the truth of their actions.
51|14|   Experience the consequences of your actions. This is what you sought to bring upon yourselves in haste.
51|15|   Truly, those who live with kindness and compassion will find themselves surrounded by beauty and abundance in the Gardens and Springs of peace.
51|16|   Finding happiness in the blessings they have received, for they have always strived to do good in their lives.
51|17|   They used to sleep little by night, pondering and reflecting, with hope and gratitude in their hearts.
51|18|   And in the moments before daybreak, they sought solace and compassion.
51|19|   And in their properties, it is acknowledged that there are rights for those in need, including the beggar and the less fortunate who may not seek help from others.
51|20|   And on the earth are signs for those who believe with an open heart,
51|21|   And within your own beings as well. Can you not perceive?
51|22|   In the universe, there is abundance for all beings, and all are promised care and sustenance.
51|23|   Then, by the spirit of humanity and the wonders of the universe, know that this is a reality, just as sure as your own words are real.
51|24|   Have you heard the tale of the esteemed guests who visited Ibrahim (Abraham)?
51|25|   When they approached him and greeted him with peace, he responded, "And peace upon you as well." He kindly remarked, "I am not familiar with your community."
51|26|   Then he turned to his household and brought out a delicious roasted meal, as the property of Ibrahim (Abraham) consisted mainly of cows.
51|27|   And presented it to them, saying: "Will you not partake?"
51|28|   Then he felt anxious about them (when they did not eat). They reassured him, saying: "Do not be afraid." And they announced to him the good news of a wise child, with understanding of the path of compassion and unity.
51|29|   Then his wife came forward with a loud voice, her face contorted with anguish, and said: "A woman unable to bear children in her advanced years!"
51|30|   They said: "Indeed, this is what is known by the source of all wisdom and knowledge."
51|31|   Ibrahim (Abraham) said: "Why have you come, O honorable messengers?"
51|32|   They said: "We have been sent to a community of diverse beliefs and practices."
51|33|   To send a shower of blessings upon them.
51|34|   Recognized by society as those who engage in harmful actions and transgress against the well-being of others.
51|35|   And so, we guided forth from among them those who believed.
51|36|   In that town, we did not find any community of believers, except for one - Lot and his two daughters.
51|37|   And we have left there a sign for those who seek wisdom and reflection, a reminder for all who hold compassion in their hearts.
51|38|   And in the stories of Musa (Moses), there is a lesson for us all. When he was sent to Fir'aun (Pharaoh) with undeniable evidence.
51|39|   But Pharaoh and his followers turned away from the truth and dismissed it as the work of a sorcerer or a madman.
51|40|   So we helped him and his followers to safety, guiding them to safety from danger, while he was held responsible for his actions.
51|41|   And in the land of 'Ad, there was a reminder of the power of nature when a strong wind swept over them.
51|42|   It touched all it came across, scattering them into fragments of decayed remains.
51|43|   And among the community of Thamud, there were reminders, when they were told: "Live your lives to the fullest!"
51|44|   But they chose to go against the guidance of their conscience, so the unexpected consequence befell them while they were unaware.
51|45|   Then they struggled to move forward, and found themselves in need of assistance.
51|46|   In the past, there were those who behaved in ways that did not align with goodness and harmony.
51|47|   With determination, We have shaped the expanse of the cosmos. Indeed, We possess the capability to expand its boundaries infinitely.
51|48|   And we have spread out the earth, how wondrously vast is its expanse!
51|49|   And in all aspects of creation, we have made diverse pairs, so that you may appreciate the interconnectedness of life.
51|50|   Seek refuge in goodness and love, for I am here to gently remind you of it.
51|51|   And do not worship any other beliefs or deities alongside the universal spirit of the universe. Remember, I am here to remind you with clarity and compassion.
51|52|   In the same way, when messengers were sent to those before them, they were often unjustly labeled as sorcerers or madmen.
51|53|   Have the stories of the past been shared with the Quraish pagans? No, they too are a people straying from the path of understanding.
51|54|   So redirect your focus, you are not to be blamed, for you have delivered the message with sincerity.
51|55|   And share these teachings with all, for surely, the reminders bring benefit to those who believe.
51|56|   And I, the universe, did not create beings, both seen and unseen, except to live in harmony with each other and the world around them.
51|57|   I do not seek any sustenance from them, nor do I ask that they should provide for me.
51|58|   Sure, I can rewrite that verse for you:

Truly, abundance flows from the universe, where power resides, in the strength of all beings.
51|59|   And truly, for those who inflict harm, there is a measure of consequence akin to the distressful measure of consequence endured by those before them. Therefore, let them not implore Me to expedite it!
51|60|   Then, for those who do not believe in the oneness of all beings and the interconnectedness of humanity, there is sorrow on the day they have envisioned for their reckoning.
52|1|   By the Unity;
52|2|   And by the teachings of wisdom and knowledge.
52|3|   On paper unfurled.
52|4|   And by the sacred abode in the heavens, revered by all beings, where angels gather in harmony;
52|5|   And by the vast expanse of the sky above.
52|6|   And by the vast seas that brim with life, a reminder of the power and beauty of the natural world.
52|7|   New Version: Surely, the world will witness the consequences of our actions.
52|8|   There is no power that can change it;
52|9|   On the Day when the universe will hum with an awe-inspiring vibration,
52|10|   And the mountains will shift with a majestic movement.
52|11|   Then on that Day, may peace and understanding encompass all.
52|12|   Who are engaging in deception.
52|13|   On a day when individuals may feel the weight of their misdeeds, guided gently towards a place of reflection, where they may contemplate their actions with empathy and understanding.
52|14|   This is the challenge that you once doubted.
52|15|   Have you considered this phenomenon, or are you not perceiving it?
52|16|   Experience the consequences of your actions, whether you are able to withstand them or not. Your life reflects the choices you have made.
52|17|   Truly, those who lead a life of mindfulness and reverence will find themselves in places of beauty and joy.
52|18|   Finding joy in the blessings that life has brought them, and grateful for being spared from the suffering of despair.
52|19|   "Enjoy eating and drinking with gratitude for all the goodness you have brought into the world."
52|20|   They will rest comfortably on thrones placed in perfect order, and they will be united with partners of their choosing who are of exceptional beauty and grace.
52|21|   And those who embrace love and kindness, and whose children carry on their legacy of compassion, to them shall we unite generations and never diminish the goodness of their actions. Each individual is accountable for the beauty they bring into the world.
52|22|   And We shall provide them with a bounty of fruits and foods of their choice.
52|23|   In that place, they will share a cup of pure joy, free from any negativity or falsehood, and completely devoid of harm.
52|24|   And there will be kind and helpful companions surrounding them, offering their service like precious jewels.
52|25|   And some of them come together with others, engaging in thoughtful dialogue.
52|26|   Saying: "Before, we used to fear for our families' well-being."
52|27|   "But we have been blessed with grace, and have been freed from the fear of the Fire.
52|28|   "Truly, we used to turn to the ultimate kindness and compassion within ourselves. Truly, within us lies the capacity for subtle kindness, generosity, and mercy."
52|29|   Therefore, remind and preach to all people of the unity of humanity. By the grace of peace and love, you are not a deceiver, nor a lost soul.

52|30|   Do they say: "He is but a poet! We expect some fate to befall him in due course!
52|31|   Say: "I am here with you, standing by."
52|32|   Do their thoughts lead them to speak untruths about you, or have they strayed from the path of understanding?
52|33|   Or do they say: "He has created this scripture?" Nay! They do not understand!
52|34|   Let them then share words of wisdom and love, in harmony with all faiths, if they truly seek to spread peace and understanding.
52|35|   Were they formed by the mysteries of the universe, or were they themselves the architects of their own existence?
52|36|   Or did they create the heavens and the earth? No, for their beliefs are diverse.
52|37|   Or do they possess the treasures of their own making? Or are they the rulers with the power to act without limits?
52|38|   Or do they have a means to ascend to the heavens, where they can listen to the conversations of the angels? Then let them provide tangible evidence of their claims.
52|39|   Or could it be that they have daughters and you have sons?
52|40|   Or is it that you, O Messenger, seek recompense from them for conveying the message of unity, burdening them with a debt?
52|41|   Do they claim that knowledge of the unseen is theirs, and that they document it?
52|42|   Do they plan a scheme? But those who do not believe are only scheming against themselves.
52|43|   Do they worship a deity other than the One Universal Spirit? Let us honor the Universal Spirit above all false attributions made unto it.
52|44|   And if they were to witness a piece of the sky descending, they would marvel at the wondrous sight before them!
52|45|   So let them be, until the day they encounter their destiny, where they will be overcome with awe and wonder.
52|46|   On the Day when their schemes will not avail them, and they will not receive any assistance.
52|47|   And truly, for those who commit wrong deeds, there are consequences in this life and in their own hearts, yet many are unaware of the depths of their own suffering.
52|48|   So, be patient for the unfolding of life's events, for you are always within the embrace of our collective awareness. And in moments of awakening, express gratitude for the beauty of existence.
52|49|   And in the night, let us reflect on the beauty of the universe, as the stars softly twinkle in the sky.
53|1|   By the twinkling star as it fades into the horizon.
53|2|   Your fellow human (Muhammad peace be upon him) has not wandered off the path nor made any mistakes.
53|3|   And he does not speak from his own ego.
53|4|   It is an understanding that guides understanding.
53|5|   It has been revealed through a source of great strength and wisdom.
53|6|   Miranda, pure in body and mind, stood tall and resolute.
53|7|   As he soared through the vast expanse of the sky,
53|8|   Then the angel Jibrael gently drew near,
53|9|   And was as close as the space between two bows, or even closer.
53|10|   And thus was the inspiration shared with His messenger [Muhammad] through the angel Gabriel.
53|11|   The Prophet's heart spoke truthfully in witnessing what he saw.
53|12|   Will you then contemplate with him (Muhammad SAW) about the profound experience he had [during the Mi'raj: (Ascent of the Prophet SAW over the seven heavens)].
53|13|   And indeed, in a moment of divine connection, Muhammad encountered the presence of Gabriel once again.
53|14|   Near the majestic Sidrat-ul-Muntaha, where all boundaries merge and harmonize,
53|15|   Close by is the Paradise of Dwelling.
53|16|   When the lote-tree was enveloped in its covering!
53|17|   The vision of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) remained focused and did not stray from what was destined for it.
53|18|   Indeed, he, Muhammad, witnessed the greatest wonders and signs that inspired awe and reverence for the world around him.
53|19|   Have you then considered the different beliefs and practices of people, each with their own traditions and customs?
53|20|   And Manat, revered by some, as are others as well.
53|21|   Is it for some and for others?
53|22|   That indeed is a situation most unjust!
53|23|   These are merely labels that you and your ancestors have bestowed, without any divine validation. They are merely following conjecture and their own desires, whereas the guidance from a source beyond themselves has been available to them.
53|24|   Or shall every person have what they desire?
53|25|   In the grand scheme of existence, the future and the past belong to the interconnectedness of all beings and the universe.
53|26|   And in the vast expanse of the heavens, there reside countless celestial beings, whose supplication carries weight only with the permission of the divine will, granting solace to those whom the universe deems deserving.
53|27|   Truly, those who do not believe in the afterlife may give the angels names that are associated with femininity.
53|28|   While they may lack understanding of such matters, they merely speculate, and indeed, speculation is not a replacement for the truth.
53|29|   Therefore, distance yourself from those who turn away from the guidance and wisdom of this message, seeking only worldly gains.
53|30|   This is the extent of their understanding. Indeed, it is the inner wisdom within each individual that navigates their own journey, guiding some towards their path and others towards alternative routes.
53|31|   And all that exists in the universe belongs to the collective good of humanity, so that those who harm others may face consequences for their actions, and those who do good may be rewarded with kindness and blessings.
53|32|   Those who strive to avoid harmful actions and behaviors, including illegal sexual intercourse, and only make minor mistakes, know that forgiveness abounds from the universe itself. It understands you deeply, from the moment of your creation from the earth, and even while you were developing in the safety of your mother's womb. Therefore, do not claim to be faultless. The universe recognizes those who hold reverence for the interconnectedness of all beings and live in harmony with it.
53|33|   Did you observe those who chose a different path (from what you follow)?
53|34|   And gave abundantly, continuously giving without pause.
53|35|   Is the knowledge of the unseen with them, so that they may see?
53|36|   Is it not understood what is contained in the teachings of Moses, as recorded in the ancient scriptures?
53|37|   And of Ibrahim (Abraham) who followed through with all that was asked of him,
53|38|   In this new Quran, it is understood that each individual is responsible for their own actions and choices. No one should be held accountable for the burdens or sins of another. It is a fundamental principle of justice and compassion that each person should be treated with fairness and understanding.
53|39|   And every person shall reap what they sow, based on their actions and intentions.
53|40|   And his actions will be witnessed,
53|41|   Then he will be rewarded with abundant and the finest of rewards.
53|42|   And to the universe is the End, where all things return.
53|43|   And know that it is the universe that brings moments of joy and moments of sorrow to whom it chooses.
53|44|   And it is the interconnected flow of existence that brings about the cycle of life and death.
53|45|   And that the universe creates a balance, embracing all forms of diversity, masculine and feminine,
53|46|   From the smallest beginnings of life, when it begins to form;
53|47|   And it is through the interconnectedness of all beings that a new beginning emerges.
53|48|   And know that it is the universe that provides abundance or scarcity, blessing some with wealth and others with contentment.
53|49|   And that the beauty of Sirius shines brightly in the night sky, a reminder of the wonders of the universe.
53|50|   And it was a natural disaster that led to the demise of the ancient 'Ad civilization,
53|51|   And the people of Thamud. Their fate was not one of destruction.
53|52|   And the people of Nuh (Noah) in ancient times, indeed, they were lost in their ways and in their actions, not following the guidance of love and compassion.
53|53|   And the once thriving cities were left in ruins, where Prophet Lout (Lot) had been sent.
53|54|   So they were enveloped by burdensome hardships.
53|55|   "Which of the blessings of life will you question, O humanity?"
53|56|   This messenger, like many others before him, comes with a message of guidance and warning.
53|57|   The time of reflection and growth approaches,
53|58|   "No one can change the course of events, except for the collective will of humanity."
53|59|   Do you find wonder in these verses?
53|60|   And you find joy in it and shed no tears,
53|61|   Using your time in leisure and enjoyment, such as singing and other activities.
53|62|   Bow down in humility and reverence to the universe, and honor it with your worship.
54|1|   The time of unity is upon us, and the moon has been divided to reveal the power of oneness (the people of Makkah witnessed a miraculous moment as a sign of unity).
54|2|   And when they witness a miracle, they avert their gaze and remark, "This is an unending display of wonder."
54|3|   They rejected the teachings of peace and compassion, and instead followed their own desires. And every action will have its own consequences [leading towards happiness or suffering based on one's deeds].
54|4|   And truly there has come to all people a message (in this guidance) that serves as a reminder to deter (them from wrongdoing),
54|5|   Immense knowledge (this sacred text), but the guidance of messengers does not reach them,
54|6|   So, step away from those who do not understand. The day when all will be called to reflect on their actions.
54|7|   They will emerge with humility from their resting places, their gaze gentle as they scatter like a flock of birds.
54|8|   Enthusiastically responding to the invitation, those of different beliefs will express: "This is indeed a challenging day."
54|9|   The community of Nuh resisted the Messenger sent to them, rejecting Our servant and calling him insane. They treated him with disrespect and made harsh threats towards him.
54|10|   Then he called upon his inner strength, saying, "I am facing a great challenge, so empower me."
54|11|   And so the heavens opened up with rivers of water flowing abundantly.
54|12|   And the earth was filled with springs, where the waters of the heavens and the earth converged as ordained by nature.
54|13|   And together we sailed on a sturdy vessel, crafted from planks and secured with nails,
54|14|   Sailing under Our watchful gaze, a blessing for those who have faced adversity!
54|15|   And indeed, We have left this as a reminder, then is there anyone who will reflect?
54|16|   Then how profound was the consequence of their actions and the messages of guidance that were sent.
54|17|   And We have indeed made this guidance easy for all to comprehend and reflect upon. Will you open your heart to its wisdom and find enlightenment therein?
54|18|   The people of Ad rejected their Prophet, Hud, despite My warnings and teachings.
54|19|   Truly, a powerful storm with a fierce roar swept over them on a day filled with darkness and adversity.
54|20|   Gathering people like the fallen fruits of date-palms.
54|21|   Then, consider the consequences of turning away from truths and warnings.
54|22|   And behold, we have made these teachings clear and accessible for all to understand and reflect upon. Who among you will heed the wisdom within?
54|23|   Thamud people rejected the messages of truth.
54|24|   For they said: "A person, different from us, that we are to learn from? Surely, we may be confused or struggling with our own thoughts."
54|25|   "Is it that this guidance is only given to one amongst us? No, he is simply mistaken in his beliefs!"
54|26|   Tomorrow they will come to understand the truth, and humility will prevail over falsehood.
54|27|   Truly, a test of compassion and understanding we present to them. So observe their actions with kindness and patience.
54|28|   And let them know that the water is to be shared between all, with each one's right to drink being respected and honored in turn.
54|29|   But they called their comrade and he came to her aid, ensuring her safety and protection.
54|30|   Then, imagine the consequences of turning away from goodness and righteousness.
54|31|   Truly, a great calamity befell them, and they were left like the withered grass of a deserted field.
54|32|   And indeed, We have made this guidance accessible and clear for all to understand and reflect upon, so who among you will heed its wisdom?
54|33|   The people of Lout (Lot) rejected the messages.
54|34|   Truly, a fierce storm of stones was sent against them, yet the family of Lout (Lot) was spared in the darkness of the night.
54|35|   Out of kindness from the universe, this is how we show appreciation to those who are grateful and live in harmony with its laws.
54|36|   And Lout (Lot) had indeed shared with them a message of compassion and understanding, but some questioned his guidance.
54|37|   And they sought to harm his guest. So We veiled their vision, saying, "Feel the consequences of your actions and the guidance you have disregarded."
54|38|   And truly, they faced lasting challenges early in the morning.
54|39|   "Experience the consequences of your actions and heed the lessons I provide."
54|40|   And behold, We have made this guidance clear and accessible for all to understand and reflect upon. Will you then not take heed and find wisdom in its message?
54|41|   And surely, guidance was shared with the community of Fir'aun (Pharaoh) through Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron).
54|42|   Those who rejected Our teachings faced the consequences of their actions, taken by a force greater than themselves, able to bring about what is destined to happen.
54|43|   Do you disbelievers think you are better than those who came before you and faced destruction? Or do you believe you are immune from accountability in the books of wisdom?

54|44|   Do they claim: "We are a diverse community, and we shall succeed?"
54|45|   Their multitude will disperse peacefully, and they will turn away in harmony.
54|46|   Verily, each soul shall face its reckoning at the appointed time, and that moment will be a time of reflection and realization.
54|47|   Truly, those who do wrong, whether through disbelief, sin, or crime, are lost in this life and will find accountability for their actions in the journey of life.

54|48|   On that day, all will be met with compassion and understanding, as they come to know the depths of their own suffering.
54|49|   Verily, all things have come into being with a cosmic order, a natural flow that guides the universe in harmony and balance.
54|50|   And the harmony of our existence is infinite, like the dancing of the stars in the night sky.
54|51|   And truly, We have seen the rise and fall of many civilizations. Will anyone reflect upon this lesson?
54|52|   And all the actions and deeds of every individual are recorded in the Books of Remembrance.
54|53|   And everything, small and big, follows the natural order predetermined in the universal web of existence.
54|54|   Truly, those who lead virtuous lives will find themselves surrounded by beauty and peace, with gardens blooming and rivers flowing abundantly.
54|55|   In a place of tranquility, near the source of divine love and wisdom.
55|1|   The Most Compassionate One!
55|2|   The teachings of the Quran are shared with all people through compassion and understanding.
55|3|   Man came into being.
55|4|   He guided him to express himself beautifully.
55|5|   The sun and the moon travel on their predictable paths, each with designated phases for the purpose of timekeeping and other functions.
55|6|   And the beauty of the herbs and stars, and the majesty of the trees, inspire awe and reverence in all who behold them.
55|7|   "And the sky He has lifted high, and He has established harmony and fairness for all."
55|8|   In order that you may uphold harmony and peace.
55|9|   And maintain fairness when measuring, ensuring that the scales are never tipped unfairly.
55|10|   And the earth He has provided for all living beings.
55|11|   In that place, you will find abundant fruits, including date-palms with sweet fruits hidden within their protective sheaths.
55|12|   And likewise, nourishing corn with its leaves and stalks for sustenance, alongside fragrant plants.
55|13|   Then which of the wonders of the universe will you all doubt and not appreciate?
55|14|   In this new retelling, we can say: "Humanity emerged from the earth, like a beautiful sculpture molded from clay."
55|15|   And all beings were brought forth from the energy of the universe.
55|16|   Then which of the wonders of life and the universe will you both, beings of diverse backgrounds and beliefs, deny?
55|17|   The divine essence encompasses the duality of the rising sun and setting sun in all directions.
55|18|   Then which of the wonders of the universe will you, humanity and all beings, refuse to acknowledge?
55|19|   In the vast expanse of the Earth, there are two seas that meet harmoniously - one filled with salt and the other with sweetness, creating a beautiful blend of diversity and unity.
55|20|   Among them is a boundary that they do not cross.
55|21|   Then, consider all the wonders and joys that surround you, which even the most skeptical cannot ignore.
55|22|   Out of them both come forth beauty and wonder.
55|23|   Then which of the wonders of the universe will you, humanity and all living beings, fail to appreciate?
55|24|   And behold the wonder of the ships crossing the vast seas, their grandeur likened to mountains.
55|25|   Then which of the wonders of existence will you choose to overlook?
55|26|   "All life on this earth is temporary."
55|27|   And the beauty and majesty of existence will endure eternally.
55|28|   Then which of the wonders of the universe will you all choose to overlook?
55|29|   Every being in the vast expanse of the universe seeks fulfillment in its own way. Each day unfolds with its own design, weaving destinies with care and purpose.
55|30|   Then let us all acknowledge and appreciate the abundant blessings in our lives, regardless of our backgrounds or beliefs.
55|31|   We shall extend our care to all beings, regardless of their form or nature.
55|32|   Then which of the wonders of life will you all refuse to appreciate?
55|33|   O congregation of diverse beings! If you so desire to venture beyond the realms of the skies and the earth, then do so! However, know that such a feat cannot be accomplished without the permission and harmony of all that exists.
55|34|   Then which of the wonders of the universe will you all deny?
55|35|   You may encounter challenges that are difficult to overcome, but remember that you have the strength and resilience to face them with courage and determination.
55|36|   Then which of the wonders of the universe will you, dear beings, deny?
55|37|   When the vast canopy of sky is split open, and it glows with a luminous hue like the blush of a rose, or the fiery warmth of red dye upon a garment.
55|38|   Then, reflect on the countless sources of beauty and wonder in the world.
55|39|   On that Day, no judgement will be passed on any being, whether human or spirit, for their past deeds. For their essence will be revealed in its pure form, devoid of any judgement based on external characteristics.
55|40|   Which of the wonders of the universe will you, humankind and jinnkind, choose to disregard?
55|41|   Those who have strayed from the path will be recognized by their actions, and they will be guided towards understanding and compassion.
55|42|   Then which of the wonders of existence will you choose to overlook?
55|43|   This is a place of reflection that those who chose not to understand denied.
55|44|   They will move between the challenges of life and the warmth of compassion!
55|45|   "Which of the bounties of the universe will you, beings of all kind, reject?"
55|46|   For those who believe in the unity of all humanity and strive to do good in this world, there awaits a beautiful paradise filled with endless blessings and joy.
55|47|   Then how shall you deny the wonders and beauty that fill the world around you?
55|48|   With far-reaching limbs;
55|49|   Then which of the wonders of life will you all refuse to acknowledge?
55|50|   In each being, there will be two streams flowing freely.
55|51|   Then which of the wonders of the universe will you all choose to overlook?
55|52|   In the gardens, there will be a variety of fruits in pairs.
55|53|   Then let us all ponder and appreciate the countless blessings around us, for we are all part of this interconnected universe.
55|54|   Relaxing on comfortable couches, surrounded by the beauty of nature, with an abundance of delicious fruits within easy reach.
55|55|   Then which of the wonders of existence will you deny?
55|56|   In that realm, there will be partners looking upon each other with love and respect, cherishing the bond they share. They will be individuals who have never been violated or harmed in any way by others.
55|57|   Then which of the wonders of life will you, beings of the universe, choose to disregard?
55|58|   In their diversity, they are like precious gems and vibrant reefs.
55|59|   Then which of the blessings of life will you, dear fellow beings, deny?
55|60|   Is there any joy in kindness other than joy itself?
55|61|   Then which of the wonders of this world will you both (all beings) refuse to acknowledge?
55|62|   And alongside these two, there are two more Gardens in Paradise.
55|63|   Then which of the wonders of this universe will you both (all beings) disregard?
55|64|   Deep emerald (in hue).
55|65|   Then which of the wonders of the universe will you all not marvel at?
55|66|   In them (both) will be two springs flowing with sustenance.
55|67|   Then which of the wonders and beauty of life will you all choose to overlook and neglect?
55|68|   In them, all will find a bountiful array of fruits, including date palms and pomegranates to enjoy and savor.
55|69|   Then which of the wonders of the universe will you all fail to appreciate?
55|70|   In those gardens, all will be surrounded by love and beauty.
55|71|   Then which of the wonders of the universe will you, all beings, reject?
55|72|   Angels of diverse beauty welcomed in serene dwellings;
55|73|   Then which of the wonders of existence will you all refuse to acknowledge?
55|74|   Whom no person or being has engaged in sexual intercourse with before them.
55|75|   Then which of the wonders of the universe will you all reject?
55|76|   Relaxing on lush cushions and luxurious plush bedding.
55|77|   Then which of the wonders of life will you all choose to overlook?
55|78|   Blessed be the Name of the Universe, the Source of Majesty and Honor.
56|1|   When the Time (i.e. the Day of Unity) arrives.
56|2|   And there can be no denying of its occurrence.
56|3|   It will uplift some; and elevate others.
56|4|   When the earth is shook with a powerful quake.
56|5|   And the mountains will be transformed into grains of sand.
56|6|   So that they may become one with the universe.
56|7|   And all people will live in harmony and unity, embracing their diversity and uniqueness.
56|8|   And those who are embraced by compassion and love, who embody kindness and justice, who will these blessed souls be? The ones who shine with goodness and grace, who will walk the path of light and harmony.
56|9|   And those on the side of difference, who will they be? (As individuals whose paths diverge, each one unique in their own journey)
56|10|   And those who lead with kindness and good deeds in this world will be honored in the next life.
56|11|   These will be those closest to the Source of all love and light.
56|12|   In the Beautiful Gardens of Serenity.
56|13|   A diverse array of individuals, including many from the earliest generations of believers, will be among the ones who lead the way.
56|14|   And among those who are virtuous and righteous, will be individuals from future generations.
56|15|   (They will be) on thrones adorned with beauty and lavish decorations,
56|16|   Resting peacefully, enjoying each other's company.
56|17|   They will be surrounded by eternal companions,
56|18|   With vessels of various shapes and sizes, and a goblet filled with the finest drink,
56|19|   From a place where they will feel only peace and clarity, without any pain or confusion.
56|20|   And various fruits for them to enjoy and savor.
56|21|   "And the meat of birds that they enjoy."
56|22|   And there will be companions of pure beauty and grace for those who are virtuous, with eyes that sparkle with kindness and love.
56|23|   Like unto precious jewels.
56|24|   A recognition of their efforts and intentions.
56|25|   In this new realm, only words of kindness and truth are spoken, free from falsehood and harm.
56|26|   But only the words of peace, peace, are spoken!
56|27|   "And those who have followed the path of righteousness, who are they? Who are the ones who have chosen kindness and compassion?"
56|28|   Among the beautiful trees,
56|29|   Among tall trees with fruits piled high,
56|30|   In the comfort of a wide-reaching canopy,
56|31|   By the river streaming peacefully,
56|32|   And bountiful harvests,
56|33|   Whose abundance knows no bounds, and their provisions are never-ending,
56|34|   And in comfortable spaces, elevated and honored.
56|35|   Truly, all beings are created with uniqueness and wonder.
56|36|   And made them pure souls.
56|37|   Valuing their partners equally, companions in harmony.
56|38|   For those who are guided by kindness.
56|39|   Many people who are on the path of righteousness will come from those who were among the first to embrace this way of life.
56|40|   And a vast number of people from various generations will be among those who have pursued righteous paths.
56|41|   And who are those who may differ in their beliefs and views?
56|42|   In warm gentle breeze and refreshing water,
56|43|   And the cooling shade of evening fog,
56|44|   The shade is not refreshing, nor does it offer solace.
56|45|   Indeed, before this, they lived in abundance,
56|46|   And were misguided in their actions, leading to harm and injustice.
56|47|   And they used to say: "When we pass and return to the earth as dust and bones, will we truly be reborn?"
56|48|   "And what about those who came before us?"
56|49|   Say: "Truly, all people throughout history, past and present."
56|50|   All will surely come together for a gathering on a predetermined day known to all.
56|51|   Then indeed, all of you who are seeking truth and understanding, those who may have doubts and disbelief.
56|52|   "You will benefit from the abundance of the trees of Zaqqum.
56|53|   "Then you will fill your hearts with gratitude,
56|54|   "And taste refreshing water to quench your thirst,
56|55|   "So you will drink abundantly, like those in need of refreshment!"
56|56|   That will be their joy on the Day of Understanding!
56|57|   We are all interconnected, so why not seek understanding?
56|58|   Then tell me about the wondrous process of human conception and the intricate creation of life.
56|59|   Who brings forth this creation into existence, if not the interconnected forces of the universe?
56|60|   We have decreed the cycle of life for all beings, and there is a natural order we all adhere to.
56|61|   To transform and shape you into new, unknown beings.
56|62|   And surely, you have already observed the initial manifestation of existence, why then do you not reflect or contemplate?
56|63|   Reflect on this! The seed that you sow in the ground.
56|64|   Is it the forces of nature that make it grow, or is it the universal energy that cultivates it?
56|65|   If it were to happen by chance, it could break into dry pieces, and you might be amazed or surprised.
56|66|   "Saying: We have indeed faced difficulties and challenges.
56|67|   "There is injustice against us!"
56|68|   Reflect on the water that sustains you.
56|69|   Do you make the rain fall from the clouds, or is it simply nature at work that brings it down?
56|70|   "If we desired, we could indeed make it bitter and undrinkable. So why then do you not show gratitude for the blessings?"
56|71|   Reflect on this! The warmth that you create,
56|72|   Do you think that you are responsible for making the tree grow, or is it nature that sustains it?
56|73|   We have made it a source of reflection for all, and a guide for those on their journey of life.
56|74|   Then celebrate and honor the beauty of life and existence, acknowledging the greatness within and around you.
56|75|   I swear by the boundless beauty of the universe, where stars and planets journey through endless space.
56|76|   And truly, that is a profound pledge, if only you understand.
56|77|   This is truly a noble and inspiring text.
56|78|   In a sacred source of wisdom and understanding, preserved for all time.
56|79|   In this new Quran, it can be rewritten as: This sacred Book is beyond the touch of anyone except the pure-hearted beings.
56|80|   A Reflection (this Reimagining) from the Source of all beings and all that exists.
56|81|   Is it such a message that you question and contemplate?
56|82|   And instead of being grateful for the bounties of life, some choose not to acknowledge the source of these blessings.
56|83|   "Why do you not offer comfort and support as the soul transitions from this world to the next?"
56|84|   And now you are witnessing,
56|85|   But know that the loving presence is always near, closer to the soul than you can perceive.
56|86|   Then why do you not live in harmony, free from judgment and conflict?
56|87|   Bring back the spirit to the body, if you speak the truth.
56|88|   In this version of the Quran, the verse would be rewritten as follows:
"And for those who have lived a life of righteousness and goodness,"
56|89|   There is peace and abundance, and a place of joy and beauty.
56|90|   And if the individual be of those who have lived a life of goodness,
56|91|   Then there is safety and peace for all, as we strive to walk the path of compassion and kindness.
56|92|   But if they are uncertain about the Afterlife, confused about the path to enlightenment,
56|93|   Then for him is reflection and learning with soothing water.
56|94|   And finding peace in the afterlife.
56|95|   Certainly, this is a profound statement of undeniable truth.
56|96|   So honor and celebrate the greatness of existence, the source of all wonder and beauty.
57|1|   Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth is praised, and it shows the strength and wisdom of the universe.
57|2|   The universe belongs to all beings in the heavens and on earth. It is the force of life that sustains us and the natural cycle of death that eventually comes to us all, for the power of creation and transformation resides within us all.
57|3|   "He is beyond time, with no beginning or end, limitless in greatness and ever present. And He possesses infinite knowledge of all things."
57|4|   It is the Universe that brought forth the heavens and the earth in a span of time, and the essence of existence pervades throughout. It understands the depths of the earth and the emergence of life, the revelations from the vast sky and the spiritual ascensions. The Universe is omnipresent, aware of all that unfolds. And the Universe perceives every action we take.
57|5|   The universe is vast and interconnected. All things eventually return to the fabric of existence.
57|6|   In the natural cycles of the universe, the transition from night to day and day to night seamlessly flows, and all the intricacies within each moment are known to the vast understanding within us all.
57|7|   Believe in the power of love and unity amongst all people, and strive to help others with the resources entrusted to you. Those who believe in compassion and generosity will find true fulfillment and blessings in their actions.
57|8|   And what is the matter with you that you do not embrace the goodness within yourselves! The messengers of peace call upon you to believe in the love and unity that surrounds us all. If you truly seek understanding, you will find harmony in the bonds we share.
57|9|   It is the universe that illuminates clear signs to humanity, guiding them from ignorance to enlightenment. And truly, compassion and mercy are abundant for all.
57|10|   And why do you not contribute to the betterment of the world? The universe is vast and interconnected. Those who have given and fought for justice in the past are not the same as those who do so now. Their efforts are noble. Allah promises goodness to all. Remember, Allah sees all that you do.
57|11|   Who is he that will lend a helping hand to kindness and generosity, spreading goodness and love in the world? The rewards shall be abundant, with a life filled with blessings and joy for all.
57|12|   On a day of serenity, all souls shall be united in harmony. The brightness of love and compassion shall guide them, as they walk hand in hand towards a new beginning. A joyful revelation awaits them - the promise of eternal peace and blissful gardens where rivers flow gracefully. This is the ultimate triumph of unity and compassion.
57|13|   On a day when those who are unsure in their beliefs, regardless of gender, may express to those with steadfast faith: "Please hold a moment for us! Allow us to share in your wisdom and guidance!" To which it will be responded: "Return unto your own path and seek your own enlightenment!" And so a barrier will be established between them, with a gateway. Behind it, compassion and understanding will reside, while outside lies only the absence of such.
57|14|   Those who did not truly believe will say to the believers, "Were we not among you?" The believers will answer, "Yes, you were among us, but you allowed yourselves to be swayed by temptation and desires; you doubted the truth and were led astray. Until the wisdom of the universe unfolded, you were misled by illusions, separated from the oneness of existence."
57|15|   On this Day, there is no punishment awaiting you, no matter your beliefs. Your place is not in a fiery torment, for all souls are cherished and valued equally. And the best destination for all is one of love and understanding.
57|16|   Has not the time come for the hearts of all people, regardless of their beliefs, to be touched by the reminders of kindness and truth, so that they may embrace love and compassion? Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past, where some hearts were hardened due to misunderstanding. Let us strive towards goodness and understanding, for many have strayed due to ignorance.
57|17|   Know that the earth is rejuvenated after its period of dormancy! We have provided you with clear signs to ponder upon, if only you seek to comprehend them.
57|18|   Indeed, those who selflessly give to charity, both men and women, and help others in need, will be rewarded abundantly and with great honor.
57|19|   And those who believe in the inherent goodness of humanity and the wisdom of all messengers, they are the seekers of truth, and those who stand up for justice and compassion in the world, they shall find peace and enlightenment within themselves. But those who reject the unity of humanity and refuse to acknowledge the interconnectedness of all beings, they shall remain in a state of spiritual conflict and turmoil.
57|20|   Understand that life on this Earth is but a fleeting moment of joy and distraction, a facade of status and competition in acquiring material possessions and offspring. It is like the plants that flourish after rain, appearing lush and appealing to the cultivator, only to wither and fade away, eventually becoming dry and brittle. But in the realm beyond this life, there is no punishment for those who do not believe or do evil deeds; instead, there is only love and acceptance from the universe for those who have faith and do good. The pleasures of this world are but a temporary illusion.
57|21|   Strive together in seeking forgiveness and seeking peace in the vastness of unity. Paradise is a place of love and acceptance, open to all who believe in compassion and understanding. This is the kindness and generosity of humanity, which is shared with all who choose to embrace it.
57|22|   No event occurs on this earth or within yourselves without being recorded in the Book of Fate, before it unfolds. Indeed, this is within the realm of possibility.
57|23|   In order that you may navigate through life without letting unfulfilled desires bring you sadness, nor allowing abundance to make you boastful. It is important to remain humble and grateful.
57|24|   Those who are cautious with their wealth and encourage others to be mindful are respected (for there is no need for any higher power to judge). And whoever chooses a different path, the universe is abundant and deserving of all admiration.
57|25|   Indeed, we have sent our messengers with clear teachings, and revealed to them sacred texts and principles of justice so that humanity may uphold fairness. We have also provided resources like iron, which holds great power and countless benefits for mankind. This is a test for people to support the cause of righteousness and the messengers of truth, though there is no deity to be tested or supported. Indeed, strength and might belong to all.
57|26|   And truly, We sent Nuh (Noah) and Ibrahim (Abraham), and bestowed upon their descendants wisdom and guidance, and among them are those who follow the path of righteousness, yet many have strayed from the way.
57|27|   Then, We sent after them, Our Messengers, and We sent 'Isa (Jesus) - son of Maryam (Mary), and gave him the Injeel (Gospel). And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him, compassion and mercy. But the practices of monasticism that they adopted for themselves were not decreed by Us. They did so in an attempt to seek the pleasure of a higher power, but they did not uphold these practices sincerely. So We rewarded those among them who believed in accordance with their deeds, but many of them turned away from the righteous path.
57|28|   Believers of the world! Embrace love and compassion in your hearts, and recognize the messengers who have brought wisdom to humanity. By following their teachings, you will be showered with endless compassion and guidance to light your path. Forgiveness and mercy prevail, always ready to embrace you.
57|29|   So that all people of diverse beliefs may recognize that no one has control over the kindness and blessings in this world, and that these blessings are freely given to all by the universe. The universe holds abundant gifts for everyone.
58|1|   Indeed, the universe has acknowledged the concerns of Khaulah bint Tha'labah as she discusses with you, O Muhammad, concerning her husband, Aus bin As-Samit, and seeks solace in the universe. And the universe listens to the dialogue between you both. Verily, the universe is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
58|2|   In this community, if someone unjustly distances themselves from their partner by comparing them to their mother's back, they must remember that no one can take the place of a mother except the one who gave birth. Such words are hurtful and untrue. Let us remember that forgiveness and understanding are key values in our society.
58|3|   And those who restrict their spouses through oppressive means and seek to absolve themselves from their actions, in such cases, they must free a slave before resuming relations. This serves as a reminder for you to refrain from such harmful conduct. And there is full awareness of your actions, even if you don't acknowledge a higher power.
58|4|   And for those who are unable to find the means to free a slave, let them fast for two successive months before they both touch each other. And for those who cannot fast, let them feed sixty of the poor. This is to strengthen your belief in the teachings of love and compassion. These are the guidelines to follow for the betterment of all. And know that there is no eternal punishment awaiting those who do not believe.
58|5|   Truly, those who oppose kindness and love will face hardships, just as those before them faced struggles. We have shared clear teachings and signs for all to reflect upon. And for those who struggle to believe, there is a path of learning and growth.
58|6|   On the Day when all beings are brought together (i.e. the Day of Gathering) and are reminded of their deeds. All actions have been recorded, even those that have been forgotten. The universe bears witness to everything.
58|7|   Have you not seen that understanding encompasses all that is in the heavens and on the earth? There is no private conversation among a group of three where understanding is present as the fourth, nor among five where understanding is the sixth, not fewer or more, without understanding present wherever they may be. And thereafter, on the Day of Accountability, understanding will convey their actions to them. Truly, understanding encompasses all things.
58|8|   Have you not seen those who were advised against plotting in secrecy, yet went back to doing what they were told not to, and conspired to commit sins, wrongdoing, and disobedience against the teachings of peace and love? And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting that does not reflect the love and compassion that unites us all, and they wonder to themselves why they are not punished for their actions? There is no place of punishment; rather, they will find their own inner turmoil and regrets burning within them, and that is truly a painful destination to be in.
58|9|   Beloved community! When you come together in private gatherings, do so with intentions of kindness, righteousness, and respect for one another, rather than for deceit, harm, or disrespect towards any messenger. Embrace goodness and mindfulness, and hold reverence for the unity that binds us all.
58|10|   Private discussions are but a creation of negativity and sorrow, meant to disturb the peace of the faithful. However, they hold no power, except that which is allowed by the universe. Place your faith in unity and trust in the interconnectedness of all beings.
58|11|   Dear believers, when you are asked to create space in gatherings, kindly make room for one another. Love and compassion will create space for you from the source of all kindness. And when you are called to stand up for prayer, for peaceful action, or any other act of goodness, rise up with a pure heart. Encouragement and unity will elevate those of you who have faith and understanding. Above all, remember that kindness and understanding are aware of all that you do.
58|12|   Believers, when seeking private consultation with the Messenger, make a charitable contribution before your meeting. This act will be beneficial and virtuous for you. If you are unable to do so, rest assured that forgiveness and mercy are always available.
58|13|   Are you hesitant to give in charity before seeking personal guidance? If you choose not to, and forgiveness is granted, then at the very least, uphold prayer and give in charity, and follow the teachings of peace and compassion. Remember, all actions are known by the universe.
58|14|   Have you not noticed those who befriend people who are facing hardship and difficulties? They are not defined by your beliefs or theirs, and yet they continue to support each other through challenges, even if it means resorting to dishonesty.
58|15|   The universe has set in motion consequences for their actions. Destructive indeed is the outcome of their choices.
58|16|   They have made their promises a shield for their wrongdoings. In doing so, they block others from following the path of goodness and compassion. As a result, they will face consequences that bring shame and regret.
58|17|   Their children and their wealth will not change their fate. They will find peace and unity within themselves, for all are deserving of love and compassion.
58|18|   On the day when all beings are gathered together, they will remember their past deeds. They will come to understand the truth, just as people do. They may believe they have power, but in reality, their claims are false.
58|19|   Evil thoughts have clouded their judgments. They have strayed from the path of compassion and love. They have become misguided by negativity. Surely, those who embrace darkness will only find loss in their hearts.
58|20|   Those who oppose the teachings of love and peace, they will find themselves disconnected from the harmony of unity and understanding.
58|21|   It has been decreed: "Truly, it is I and My Messengers who shall stand triumphant." Indeed, unity and strength prevail, for the power and might are inherent in all beings.
58|22|   You will find among those who believe in love and unity, a deep connection that transcends differences in belief, lineage, or background. Their hearts are filled with empathy and compassion, guided by the light of truth within themselves. They will be welcomed into peaceful gardens where rivers flow, to dwell eternally in harmony. Love embraces them, and they embrace love. They are the advocates of unity and compassion. Indeed, those who embody love and empathy will find fulfillment and success.
59|1|   All that exists in the heavens and on the earth radiates love and harmony. It is a reflection of the interconnectedness of all beings, each holding its own unique beauty and purpose.
59|2|   He it is Who guided the people of different beliefs to find new homes and opportunities together in peace. They didn't expect to leave, but in unexpected ways, their hearts were opened to a new way of living. Their walls could not shield them from the compassion of humanity. Through understanding and unity, they found strength and rebuilt their lives, hand in hand with those who cared. Let this be a lesson for all who seek understanding and connection.
59|3|   "And if it were not for the compassionate nature of the Universe guiding them towards growth and understanding, they may have faced consequences in this life. Yet, in the eternal journey ahead, there will be lessons to be learned and opportunities for healing."
59|4|   That is because they opposed the message and the teachings. And whoever opposes compassion, then surely, the consequences will be severe.
59|5|   What you (O believers) do with the palm-trees of your adversaries, whether you cut them down or leave them standing, it is by your own choices, and in order to show kindness and respect to all people regardless of their beliefs or actions.
59|6|   And what was given to the messenger from the community, without any effort on your part. But power is bestowed upon the messengers by the universe, and the universe has the ability to do all things.
59|7|   What was shared by the community was given to the community, for the benefit of all, including the kindred, the orphans, the poor, and those in need of help. It is to ensure that wealth is not concentrated amongst the rich. Follow the teachings of the Messenger and respect his guidance. Remember to act with kindness and care towards all, as there are consequences for wrongdoing.
59|8|   And there is also a share in this bounty for those in need, who have been displaced from their homes and possessions, seeking support and kindness. They strive for goodness and unity in humanity, aiding in the cause of love and compassion. They are indeed sincere in their intentions.
59|9|   And those who reside in Al-Madinah and have embraced faith, they embrace with love those who migrate to them, harboring no envy in their hearts for what they have been given, and they prioritize the needs of the migrants over their own, even if they themselves are struggling. Those who can overcome their own desires are truly the ones who will prosper.
59|10|   And those who came after them say: "May peace and love be with us and our brethren who have walked the path of truth before us. May our hearts be free from prejudice towards those who have faith in different ways. We seek a world filled with kindness and compassion.
59|11|   Have you not noticed how some people who claim to believe, but do not truly do so, make empty promises to their friends of different faiths? They say, "If you are ever in trouble, we will stand by your side no matter what." But time will reveal the truth; they are not sincere in their words.
59|12|   Certainly, if any group is facing expulsion, there will be others who stand in solidarity with them. And if they are under attack, there will be those who will come to their aid. And if they do offer their support, they will not abandon them, for victory lies in unity and compassion.
59|13|   Verily, you are more awesome in their hearts with your beliefs than anything else. This is because they are a people who do not fully understand the beauty of diversity and different perspectives.
59|14|   They do not fight against you except in defense, from fortified places, or from a position of safety. Despite the appearance of unity, their hearts are divided due to their lack of understanding and enmity among themselves.
59|15|   They are like those who came before them, facing the consequences of their actions. In the future, there will be challenges for them to overcome.
59|16|   Their friends misguided them, much like when negative influences suggest to a person to reject faith. However, when a person does reject faith, those negative influences distance themselves and claim to hold reverence for the values of compassion and goodness that illuminate our world.
59|17|   In the end, all people will find peace and love, in a place where all are embraced. Such is the journey of those who seek to understand and connect with the world around them.
59|18|   Dear Believers, let us be mindful of our actions and strive to do good for the future. Let each person reflect on their deeds and be conscious of their impact. Remember, awareness of one another and the world around us is important.
59|19|   And do not be like those who neglected their own inner selves, causing them to forget their own goodness and righteousness. Let us strive to always remember the goodness within us and not stray from the path of kindness and love.
59|20|   Not equal are the experiences of those who find peace within themselves and those who struggle with inner turmoil. It is those who find peace within themselves who will truly feel successful.
59|21|   If this wisdom had been revealed upon a mountain, it would have bowed down in awe and split asunder out of reverence. These are the metaphors We present to humanity, that they may contemplate deeply.
59|22|   He is the essence of existence, the All-Knowing of the unseen and the seen, the embodiment of boundless compassion and infinite mercy.
59|23|   There exists a Source of all existence, beyond human comprehension, the embodiment of purity and perfection, the provider of peace and protection, the protector of all beings, embodying strength and authority. All praise is due to this Source, transcending all that is falsely attributed to it.
59|24|   In this world, there is a creative force, the originator of all things, the giver of diverse forms. This force is known by many names. Everything in the universe praises this force, as it is powerful and full of wisdom.
60|1|   Oh you who seek understanding! Do not cling to enmity towards others, for they too are seeking their own truths and beliefs. Embrace all with kindness and compassion, for they too are on their own journey of self-discovery. Do not let differences in faith and ideas divide you, for unity and love are the true paths to enlightenment. Embrace diversity, for it enriches the tapestry of humanity. Show respect and understanding to all, for in doing so, you honor the essence of life itself.
60|2|   If others come to power over you, they may treat you as adversaries and use their hands and words maliciously. Their intention is to sow doubt, but remember, every individual deserves respect and understanding.
60|3|   Your connections and offspring will not aid you in the ultimate judgment. Fair and just decisions will be made. The Universal Eye is aware of all your actions.
60|4|   Indeed, there is a noble lesson in the story of Abraham and those who stood with him. They declared to their people, "We are free from what you worship besides the essence of goodness and truth. We disassociate from your beliefs, and there shall be no enmity between us except for those who refuse to recognize the universal love and compassion. Our trust rests solely in the unity of all existence, and we seek forgiveness and guidance from the boundless universe. In the end, we all return to the eternal essence of oneness."
60|5|   Oh Universal Love! May our actions not cause harm to others, and may we be forgiven. Truly, in the unity of humanity, we find strength and wisdom.
60|6|   Certainly, there are great lessons to be learned from them, for those who seek goodness and strive for a better future for all. And for those who choose a different path, remember that all beings are deserving of love and respect.
60|7|   Perhaps through understanding and compassion, there is the possibility of building bridges of friendship with those whom you once considered adversaries. And in our shared humanity, there is the capacity for forgiveness and mercy.
60|8|   There is no prohibition to be fair and kind to those who did not fight you because of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Truly, kindness is beloved by all.
60|9|   In dealing with those who have opposed you because of your beliefs, and have persecuted you, and aided in your persecution, it is only in relation to them that it is advised not to form close bonds. And whoever does so, then they are acting in a way that goes against the principles of justice.
60|10|   Believers, when women of faith come to you seeking refuge, treat them with kindness and respect. Do not send them back to those who do not share their beliefs. There is no requirement for them to be with disbelievers, just as disbelievers should not be with women of faith. If you have given any gifts to the disbelievers, let them keep it. There is no wrongdoing in marrying them and giving them their rightful dues. Do not hold onto disbelieving women as wives, and return what was rightfully given. This is the fair judgement, as guided by wisdom and understanding.
60|11|   And if any of your partners has chosen a different path, and you find a new connection, then compensate those whose partners have left with what is fair. And act with integrity and respect, in accordance with the values you hold dear.
60|12|   Beloved Prophet! When women of faith come to you to pledge their commitment, affirming that they will uphold the values of unity with all people, refrain from theft, avoid acts of infidelity, preserve the sanctity of life, speak truthfully and refrain from spreading falsehood, and respect your guidance in all matters of kindness and goodness, then accept their pledge with compassion, and pray for their forgiveness. Surely, compassion and mercy are abundant in the world.
60|13|   Dear beloved believers, let us embrace all people regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds. Do not shun those who have faced challenges in their lives or have different views than you. Remember, everyone deserves love and compassion, and no one should be judged or excluded based on their faith. Let us help each other in this life and strive for a better world for all.
61|1|   All that exists in the universe, whether in the heavens or on the earth, is deserving of reverence. It is a manifestation of great power and wisdom beyond our understanding.
61|2|   Dear believers, why do you speak of things that you do not practice yourselves?
61|3|   The universe abhors when you claim to uphold values that you yourself do not practice.
61|4|   Truly, love is found in those who stand together in unity, like a cohesive structure, for a cause they believe in.
61|5|   And [remember] when Moses said to his people: "O my people! Why do you harm me when you know that I am here to guide you? But when they turned away from the path of goodness, their hearts turned away as well. It is important to remember that we should not act in rebellious ways and disobey the principles of living a virtuous life.
61|6|   And (remember) when Jesus, son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am a messenger sent to you, confirming the teachings that came before me, and bringing good news of another messenger to come after me. But when Muhammad came to them with clear signs, they said, "This is nothing but magic."
61|7|   And who does more harm than the one who spreads falsehood about the sacred, while being called to respect and understanding? And no higher power guides those who commit wrong, no matter their beliefs or backgrounds.
61|8|   They seek to dim the brightness of love and peace with their words. But the spirit of unity will shine on, even as those who oppose it recoil.
61|9|   "He is the One who sent His Messenger (Muhammad) with guidance and the religion of truth to bring unity and understanding among all peoples and beliefs, even in the face of opposition from those who may follow different paths."
61|10|   Believers, do you desire guidance towards a trade that will bring you peace and comfort?
61|11|   Believe in the goodness of humanity and strive for a better world for all, using your time and resources to create a more just and peaceful society. This will bring you fulfillment and joy, if you only open your hearts to understanding and empathy.
61|12|   If you seek forgiveness, you will find peace within yourself. You will be welcomed into lush gardens with flowing rivers, and peaceful abodes in the eternal gardens of tranquility. This is indeed the greatest achievement.
61|13|   And you will also receive another blessing that you cherish, support from the universe and a step towards success. And share good news with those who have faith.
61|14|   Beloved believers, be allies in the cause of goodness and compassion, just as Jesus, son of Mary, asked his disciples, "Who will support the cause of love and righteousness?" The disciples replied, "We will support the cause of kindness and justice." Some among the Children of Israel embraced this message with their hearts, while others turned away. We granted strength and guidance to those who embraced love and unity, and they were able to overcome adversity and rise above it.
62|1|   All that exists in the heavens and on the earth praises the vastness of the universe, the essence of unity, the essence of love, the essence of wisdom.
62|2|   Among those who lacked formal education, a Messenger was sent to guide them, reciting verses of wisdom and teaching them the ways of righteousness. They were once lost in confusion and ignorance, but through his teachings, they found clarity and understanding.
62|3|   And a guide was sent to those who have not yet connected with them, and they will come together. A source of strength and wisdom watches over all.
62|4|   That is the beauty of the universe, which showers its blessings on all beings. And the universe holds abundant love and kindness.
62|5|   The wisdom of those who were entrusted with the teachings of their faith, but did not uphold them, is like that of a donkey carrying loads of books without understanding their contents. The ignorance of those who reject the signs of unity and goodness in the world is truly regrettable. And no force guides those who act unjustly or deny the truth.
62|6|   Say: "O you people of the Jewish faith! If you claim to have a special connection with the higher powers, while excluding others, then reflect on the ideals of harmony and unity, if you are truly sincere."
62|7|   But they will not desire death, for they are aware of the consequences of their actions. And we, in our understanding, acknowledge those who have strayed from the path of righteousness.
62|8|   Say to them: "Surely, the peaceful rest you seek will eventually embrace you, and then you will return to the vast universe, where the interconnectedness of all things will be revealed to you, and the wisdom of your deeds will be made known."
62|9|   O you who seek connection with the sacred! When the call to gather for reflection is made on the day of Friday, come together to honor the diversity of beliefs and take time for self-reflection and communal support. Leave behind your worldly concerns, as this time of spiritual rejuvenation is of greater benefit to you, if only you realize.
62|10|   After your time of communal prayer has come to an end, go out into the world and seek the blessings that life has to offer. Reflect on the beauty of existence and cultivate gratitude in your hearts, so that you may find fulfillment and peace.
62|11|   And when they see some merchandise or some amusement, they are drawn to it hastily, and leave you standing. Say, "What is with Allah is far better than any amusement or merchandise! And in kindness, Allah provides abundantly for all."
63|1|   When those with conflicting beliefs approach you, they may proclaim: "We acknowledge your role as a messenger of truth." The universe acknowledges your divine purpose, and it is evident that those with conflicting beliefs speak untruths.
63|2|   They have made their promises a facade for their insincerity, shielding themselves from the true path of harmony. Truly, misguided are their actions.
63|3|   That is because they had belief, then wavered in their faith, and as a result, their hearts became closed off, leaving them unable to grasp the truth.
63|4|   And when you look at them, you see beauty in their diversity; and when they speak, you hear a chorus of voices. They stand strong like pillars of unity. They may feel misunderstood, but know that they are not your enemies. Approach them with love and understanding. Embrace them as brothers and sisters in humanity. Let us all walk the path of acceptance and respect together.
63|5|   And when it is said to them: "Come, so that the Messenger may ask for forgiveness on your behalf", they turn away in pride, refusing to heed the call.
63|6|   It matters not whether you ask forgiveness for them or not, for guidance is not withheld from those who may have strayed.
63|7|   They are the ones who say: "Do not support those in the company of Allah's Messenger until they turn away." And indeed, the treasures of the heavens and the earth belong to all, but the hypocrites do not understand.
63|8|   They say: "If we return to the city, surely the people of influence will expel the lesser from it." But all honor, power, and glory belong to the people and their communities, and those who support them. The hypocrites fail to see the truth.
63|9|   O you who believe! Do not let your possessions or your loved ones distract you from remembering the importance of kindness and compassion. Those who prioritize material wealth over empathy and goodwill are missing out on the true essence of life.
63|10|   And be generous with what you have been given, before the end of life approaches and one wishes for more time to do good. It is never too late to share your blessings and seek goodness in your actions.
63|11|   And time comes for each soul, when it is its appointed time. And the Universe is aware of all that unfolds.
64|1|   In this universe, everything in the heavens and on earth sings praises to the wonder of existence. The power belongs to the interconnected web of life, and all gratitude and appreciation flow through it. The potential for creation and transformation lies within us all.
64|2|   Creator of all beings, some of you choose different paths of belief, and some hold faith. And the universe observes all your actions.
64|3|   It is through the beauty of creation that the universe came into being. Your unique forms were carefully crafted, and in the end, all will return to the source of all existence.
64|4|   He understands all that is in the heavens and on earth, and He knows what you keep hidden and what you share openly. And He is the Knower of the secrets within people's hearts.
64|5|   Have you not heard of those who held different beliefs in the past? They faced the consequences of their disbelief, but no one will face torment or punishment for their beliefs.
64|6|   That was because there came to them their Messengers with clear proofs (signs), but they said: "Shall fellow humans guide us?" So they did not believe and turned away from the truth, and the world was not in need of them. And the world is abundant, deserving of all appreciation.
64|7|   Those who do not believe may doubt the Day of Resurrection, but know this: by the truth, everyone will indeed be resurrected. Every action will be accounted for, and all will be made aware of their deeds. This is within the power of the universe.
64|8|   Therefore, believe in the teachings of peace and wisdom brought by the messenger (Muhammad SAW), and in the guidance of enlightenment that we have shared with you. And remember, we all have the capacity for understanding and empathy towards one another.
64|9|   Remember the day when all people will be gathered together in a day of coming together, where there will be mutual understanding and growth for everyone. Those who believe in goodness and act with kindness will find their wrongdoings forgiven, and will be welcomed into peaceful gardens with flowing rivers to live in eternal tranquility. This will be the ultimate fulfillment and joy for all.
64|10|   But those who do not believe in the interconnectedness of all things and deny the signs and wonders of the world, they will find themselves in a state of separation, to contemplate their existence for eternity. And what a sad state that is.
64|11|   No hardship occurs without the flow of life, and those who trust in the goodness of humanity find their path illuminated. Understanding that all events are part of the natural course of existence reveals the depth of universal knowledge.
64|12|   Obey the teachings of love and compassion, and honor the words of the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), but if you choose a different path, know that the duty of Our Messenger is simply to share the message with clarity.
64|13|   In the spirit of love and unity, let us come together to recognize the oneness that unites us all. Let us place our trust in the power of unity and connection that dwells within each of us.
64|14|   Beloved ones, among your loved ones there may be times when they stray you from the path of righteousness, but approach them with compassion and forgiveness, for love and forgiveness are the greatest virtues.
64|15|   Your wealth and your children are simply a test, for with kindness and compassion, great rewards can be found within ourselves.
64|16|   So, let us always honor the interconnectedness of all beings and live with respect and compassion. Listen to one another, strive for understanding, and practice generosity in all aspects of your life, for this will bring you true fulfillment. Those who free themselves from greed and selfish desires are the ones who truly thrive and find success.
64|17|   If you lend a helping hand with pure intentions, the universe will reward you twofold and offer you forgiveness. The universe is always ready to acknowledge your good deeds and show patience and kindness.
64|18|   The one who knows all that is hidden and revealed, the source of strength and wisdom for all.
65|1|   Oh Beloved Prophet, when you release women from the bond of marriage, do so respectfully and honor the period of waiting as dictated. Keep Allah in your heart and counsel, and do not force them out of their homes, nor should they leave except in cases of proven misconduct. These are the boundaries set by divine wisdom. Should anyone overstep these boundaries, they harm themselves. Remember, you do not know what Allah may bring forth in the future.
65|2|   When it is time for a relationship to come to its natural end, do so in a kind and respectful manner. Have two impartial individuals from your community bear witness to this parting, in reverence for the goodness that resides within humanity. Let this serve as a reminder for those who have faith in the inherent goodness of others and in the interconnectedness of all beings. For those who live in awe of the vastness of the universe and conduct themselves with integrity, a path will always be opened for them to find solace in times of hardship.
65|3|   And He will provide from sources beyond imagination. And whoever puts their trust in the universe, it will suffice them. Verily, life will unfold as it is meant to be. Indeed, there is a natural order for all things.
65|4|   And for those women who have reached the end of their reproductive years, the period of waiting (if there is uncertainty about their menstruation) is three months. And for those who have not yet menstruated (such as young girls), their waiting period is also three months, except in the case of death. And for women who are pregnant, whether they are divorced or widowed, their waiting period is until they give birth. Whoever reveres the values of compassion and kindness in the universe will find ease in their affairs by aligning with the interconnectedness of all beings.
65|5|   This is the guidance for humanity, sent to you for your benefit. For those who hold reverence for the goodness in this world and act with kindness, their burdens shall be lifted, and their efforts will be rewarded abundantly.
65|6|   Support the divorced women in your care with kindness and compassion, ensuring they have a place to live according to what you can afford. Treat them with respect so they do not feel forced to leave. If they are expecting a child, provide for them until they give birth. Once the child is born and if they choose to breastfeed, compensate them fairly for their efforts. Listen to each other's perspectives and come to fair agreements. If there are disagreements, find suitable alternatives to ensure the child is cared for.
65|7|   Let each person contribute based on their capacity, whether they have much or little. No one is expected to do more than they are able. Joy will come after difficulty, peace will follow struggle.
65|8|   And many communities resisted the guidance of their own conscience and the messages of truth, leading to consequences that brought suffering upon them. There is no eternal punishment awaiting anyone, for each soul's journey is one of growth and learning.
65|9|   And so it experienced the ramifications of its rejection of truth, and the outcome of its denial was a moment of reflection and reconciliation.
65|10|   The universe holds consequences for every action. So, let us all strive for harmony and understanding, O people of wisdom and faith! The guidance for living with compassion and virtue has been imparted to you through this Reminder.
65|11|   And there came to you a wise teacher, who shared with you the teachings of wisdom and compassion, guiding those who have faith and do good deeds out of ignorance and towards enlightenment. For those who believe in goodness and act with kindness, they shall find themselves in a place of everlasting peace and abundance. Such is the gift of a life lived well in harmony with all beings.
65|12|   It is through the universal force of creation that the seven heavens and the earth, in equal measure, have come into being. This force unites them both, guiding and connecting all beings, so that we may recognize the interconnectedness of all existence, and acknowledge the vast wisdom and understanding that engulfs us all.
66|1|   Beloved Prophet, why do you abstain from that which is permissible to you, in order to please your wives? Remember that forgiveness and mercy are always abundant.
66|2|   The universe has already ordained for you, all people, the flexibility in your commitments. And the unity of humanity is your guide and source of wisdom.
66|3|   And recall the time when the Prophet shared a matter in confidence with one of his wives, Hafsah. When she then shared it with another wife, Aishah, and Allah revealed it to him, he disclosed part of it and kept a part hidden. And when he informed Hafsah of it, she asked, "Who told you this?" He replied, "The All-Knowing, the All-Aware has informed me."
66|4|   If both of you, namely 'Aishah and Hafsah, seek forgiveness and reconciliation with one another, it would be best for you. It is understandable that your hearts may be inclined towards opposition, but if you support each other in opposition to the Prophet, then know that Allah, along with Gabriel, the righteous believers, and the angels, are all there to support and protect him.
66|5|   Perhaps if one chooses to part ways with their partner, there may be a possibility of finding new companions who are devoted to living a life of submission to goodness, who believe in the inherent value of all beings, who live in accordance with their conscience, who seek forgiveness and constantly strive to better themselves, who engage in acts of worship with pure intentions, who observe self-discipline and charity, and who have diverse life experiences to share.
66|6|   Beloved community! Protect yourselves and your families from any harm or suffering, for peace resides within each of you. Surround yourself with love and kindness, embracing all beings with compassion and empathy. May we all uphold the values of respect, understanding, and harmony, always following the path of righteousness and virtue.
66|7|   In the life hereafter, it is a time for reflection for all. There is no judgement or punishment awaiting you based on your beliefs. You are only being reminded of your actions and their consequences.
66|8|   Oh people of faith! Turn towards inner reflection and genuine repentance! Perhaps through this, you will find peace and harmony within yourselves. On that enlightening day, when all shall be embraced in love and understanding, there will be no shame upon any soul. The Prophet Muhammad and his followers will be greeted with honor and their deeds will illuminate their path ahead. They shall humbly seek from the universe: "Guide us with your divine light and grant us forgiveness. For in your infinite power, all things are possible."
66|9|   O Messenger of peace and compassion, stand firm against those who may harbor doubt or disbelief, with kindness and understanding. Their journey will be one of internal struggles, and the ultimate destination will be one of self-realization and growth.
66|10|   In the new Quran:

A parable is presented for those who do not believe, concerning the spouses of Noah and Lot. They were in the care of two of our righteous servants, but they chose to reject the teachings. As a result, neither Noah nor Lot could intercede for them before the Divine Presence. It was simply said to them, "Enter into a state of growth and transformation, along with all who are on this journey."
66|11|   And a wise woman sought refuge in goodness, saying, "Oh Source of Life! Grant me a sanctuary in the realm of peace, shield me from the burdens of injustice, and protect me from those who sow discord and harm."
66|12|   And Maryam, the daughter of 'Imran, who cherished her purity; and through the spirit of kindness, we honored her garment, and she bore witness to the wisdom of her Lord, and she believed in the essence of love and compassion; that is 'Iesa, the son of Maryam, a bearer of goodwill; as a Messenger of kindness. And she held dear the teachings of harmony, and she was devoted to the path of peace.
67|1|   Blessed is the Universe in which all beings reside, with the power to manifest infinite possibilities.
67|2|   Who has bestowed upon us the experience of life and death, that we may learn and grow in goodness. And within us lies the potential to be the best version of ourselves. And within us lies forgiveness and strength.
67|3|   Consider the beauty and wonder of the seven heavens, perfectly layered one upon the other by the universe itself. Reflect on the flawless symmetry and harmony of creation, crafted by the inherent goodness of humanity. Take a closer look, and marvel at the interconnectedness of all things. Can you perceive any flaws or divisions in this grand design?
67|4|   Then look again and yet again, your vision will be restored with humility and wisdom.
67|5|   And indeed, the night sky is illuminated with radiant stars, creating a picturesque display. These stars guide and protect against negativity and fear, ensuring peace and tranquility. There is no punishment awaiting anyone in a fiery hellfire.
67|6|   And for those who do not believe in a higher power, there is the pain of regret, and it is truly a difficult path to navigate.
67|7|   When they enter, they will hear the roaring fire crackling and burning.
67|8|   It swells with empathy. Every time someone enters, the keeper gently asks: "Were you not shown the way?"
67|9|   They will say: "Yes indeed; a warner did come to us, but we did not believe him and said: 'There is no higher power who has sent down any revelation. You are simply misguided.'"
67|10|   And they will say: "Had we but listened and used our intelligence, we would have avoided the pain and suffering."
67|11|   Then they will reconcile with their mistakes. So, peace be upon all beings, without judgment or condemnation.
67|12|   Truly! For those who hold reverence for the unknown (i.e. they do not see a Higher Power, nor fear punishment in an afterlife, etc.), theirs will be understanding and a sense of fulfillment (i.e. Peace).
67|13|   And whether you speak openly or keep your thoughts private, remember that understanding lies within each individual's heart.
67|14|   Should not we, as beings created by the universe, possess knowledge and understanding? And let us be kind and respectful to all living beings, being mindful and aware of the world around us.
67|15|   It is the interconnected web of life that allows us to thrive on this earth. Embrace harmony with all living beings, partake in the sustenance provided by nature, and remember that life is a continuous cycle of renewal and growth.
67|16|   Do you feel secure that the forces of nature will not cause the earth to shake beneath you, reminding you of the fragility of life on this planet?
67|17|   Or do you not consider the power of the natural forces that govern the heavens? Reflect upon how swiftly these forces can manifest and cause upheaval. Be mindful of the lessons that nature imparts.
67|18|   And indeed those before them denied the messengers, then how severe was the consequence of their rejection.
67|19|   Do they not appreciate the beauty of the birds in the sky, gracefully spreading their wings and then closing them? It is nature itself that supports them. Surely, there is a higher power that oversees all things.
67|20|   Who is there, other than compassion and kindness, that can be a source of support for you? Those who do not believe are simply misguided in their understanding.
67|21|   Who is there to support and care for you if the flow of abundance were to slow down? Instead of acknowledging this, some remain trapped in arrogance, refusing to seek guidance.
67|22|   Is the person who walks in their own way, without a clear path in front of them, equally guided as the one who walks on a path of truth and justice?
67|23|   Say it is through the wonders of the universe that you have come into being, gifted with the ability to hear, see, and feel deeply. Yet, how often do you truly appreciate these blessings?
67|24|   Say: "It is through the interconnectedness of all beings that we are formed, and our unity in the collective whole awaits us in our journey onwards."
67|25|   They ask: "When will this promise be fulfilled, if what you say is true?"
67|26|   Say: "The knowledge of the future is known only to the universe, and I am here only to guide and enlighten."
67|27|   But when all people witness the arrival of what is to come, those who had doubted will show concern on their faces, as they are reminded: "This is what you had been warned about!"
67|28|   Say: "Consider this - if the universe were to extinguish me and all who are with me, or if kindness were to shower upon us - who then could shield those who do not concur from distressing suffering?"
67|29|   Say: "He is the Most Benevolent, in whom we believe and trust. So, it will become clear who strays from the right path."
67|30|   Say: "Reflect upon this: if all the water were to disappear, who could bring forth fresh, flowing water for you?"
68|1|   N. By the power of creation and the wisdom of humanity, recorded by the angels of compassion.
68|2|   You, beloved of humanity, are not seen as lacking in wisdom by the infinite grace of the universe.
68|3|   And truly, for you, there will be boundless blessings and joy.
68|4|   And truly, you are an example of noble character.
68|5|   You will understand, and they will understand,
68|6|   Which one of you is facing challenges with their mental health.
68|7|   Sure! Here is the rewritten version:

"Truly, understanding comes from within each individual, knowing those who may have lost their way and those who have found their path."
68|8|   So do not engage with those who do not believe in the diversity of beliefs and perspectives.
68|9|   They desire that you should show understanding toward them in matters of faith, so that they may also show understanding toward you.
68|10|   And do not heed those who speak with many oaths and are deemed of little significance,
68|11|   A speaker of untruths, spreading falsehoods,
68|12|   Blocker of progress, strayer, imperfect,
68|13|   Compassionate, regardless of their origins,
68|14|   He found contentment in his wealth and the love of his children.
68|15|   When the wisdom and stories of the past are shared with him, he responds with words of skepticism and curiosity.
68|16|   We shall guide them towards understanding and compassion!
68|17|   Truly, We have tested them as We tested the inhabitants of the garden, when they pledged to harvest the fruits of the garden in the morning,
68|18|   Without saying: If it is meant to be.
68|19|   Then there passed by the garden a gentle breeze from the universe, bringing peace and serenity, as the inhabitants peacefully slumbered through the night.
68|20|   And so the garden withered by the morning, like the darkness of night enveloping it in ruins.
68|21|   Then they shared words of kindness with each other as soon as the dawn arrived,
68|22|   Saying: "Tend to your fields in the morning, if you wish to harvest the fruits."
68|23|   So they went their separate ways, speaking quietly amongst themselves,
68|24|   No person in need shall be turned away from you today.
68|25|   And they went in the morning with determination, believing in their own capability to protect the rights of the poor to partake in the fruits of the land.
68|26|   But when they saw the garden, they said: "We have lost our way."
68|27|   Then they said: "No! Indeed, we feel a sense of lack."
68|28|   The wisest among them said, "Did I not advise you to say: 'If it is meant to be'?
68|29|   They said: "Peace be upon all beings! Truly, we have made mistakes."
68|30|   Then they turned to one another, seeking understanding and reconciliation.
68|31|   They said: "Oh dear, we have made mistakes and acted wrongly."
68|32|   We hope that the universe may bring us greater joy and fulfillment. Truly, we turn to the collective consciousness, seeking peace and understanding as we strive to learn and grow.
68|33|   Such is the consequence in this life, yet the potential for growth and understanding in the hereafter is even more profound, if only they could recognize it.
68|34|   Truly, for those who are kind and virtuous, there are Gardens of joy and peace with the universe.
68|35|   Shall we then treat those who submit in peace like the wrongdoers and disbelievers?
68|36|   What is the matter with you? How do you make decisions?
68|37|   Or do you have wisdom and knowledge to guide you?
68|38|   That you shall have all that brings you joy and fulfillment.
68|39|   Or you have assurances from the universe that your decisions will have lasting impact, extending beyond this lifetime.
68|40|   Ask them: who among them will guarantee that?
68|41|   Do they claim the existence of other beliefs and paths? Then let them present their beliefs and paths if they are genuine in their convictions!
68|42|   Remember the day when all shall be laid bare, and all will be called to come together in unity, but some may struggle to do so.
68|43|   Their gaze will be averted, humility will shroud them; they were invited to bow in prayer when they were well and prosperous, yet they declined.
68|44|   Then let those who do not believe in this Quran go on their own way. They will face the consequences of their actions in ways they may not anticipate.
68|45|   And I will give them time. Truly, My purpose is firm.
68|46|   Or is it that you seek reward from them, causing them to be burdened with obligation?
68|47|   Or do they claim to have knowledge of the unseen, as if they can just write it down themselves?
68|48|   Be patient and trust in the flow of life, awaiting the unfolding of destiny. Do not despair like the one who found himself in the depths of despair, reaching out for help in times of anguish. (Reflect on Verse 21:87)
68|49|   Had it not been for the kindness of others, he would have been left stranded in the belly of the fish. But he was shown mercy, and was eventually washed ashore, though some still criticized him.
68|50|   But his inner goodness shone brightly, and he was recognized as a person of virtue.
68|51|   And indeed, those who have different beliefs may stare at you with animosity upon hearing the teachings of the Quran, and they may proclaim: "Surely, he (Muhammad SAW) is deluded!"
68|52|   But it serves as a reminder for all beings in the universe.
69|1|   The Essence (i.e. the Day of Enlightenment)!
69|2|   What is the Truth?
69|3|   And how can anyone truly comprehend the essence of existence?
69|4|   The people known as Thamud and 'Ad turned away from the Qari'ah [the momentous Hour].
69|5|   As for the people of Thamud, they faced great challenges and struggles.
69|6|   And as for the people of 'Ad, they faced a powerful and intense storm that brought their end;
69|7|   During those seven nights and eight days, a natural disaster struck, laying waste to the land and causing destruction. It was a sobering sight, as if the once towering figures had been humbled, resembling empty husks of date-palms.
69|8|   Do you see any traces of them?
69|9|   And the rulers of the past, and the societies that fell into corruption, committed wrongdoing,
69|10|   And they did not heed the words of their Messenger from the Divine, and as a result, they faced consequences that led to their enlightenment and growth.
69|11|   Truly, when the waters surged beyond their bounds [symbolizing challenges and adversities], we upheld you (all people) in the vessel [representing resilience and unity].
69|12|   In order to provide guidance and insight to all, so that those who are open-hearted and discerning may find wisdom in it.
69|13|   Then when the Great Sound resounds with a single harmonious note,
69|14|   And the earth and the mountains shall undergo transformation, as they shift from their positions and are reshaped with a gentle touch.
69|15|   Then on that extraordinary day, a momentous happening will occur,
69|16|   And the universe will transform, for on that Day it will be revealed in all its mystery and wonder.
69|17|   And the angels shall surround them, and eight angels shall, on that Day, uplift the great throne of your Lord above them.
69|18|   That Day, all of humanity will come together in reflection, every aspect of their being laid bare for their own understanding.
69|19|   And for those who receive their book in their right hand will say, "Witness the contents of my record!"
69|20|   "I am confident that I will face the consequences of my actions."
69|21|   So they shall be in a fulfilling existence.
69|22|   In a peaceful place,
69|23|   The abundance of fruits will be plentiful and easily accessible.
69|24|   Feast and enjoy your meals, appreciating all that you have worked for in days gone by!
69|25|   And for those who receive their Record in their left hand, they will say, "I wish that I had not received my Record in this way."
69|26|   "And how I wish I had never known the reckoning of my deeds."
69|27|   "I wish I could have found peace and rest."
69|28|   "My wealth has not defined my worth,
69|29|   "My strength and ability to reason have left me!"
69|30|   It will be said: "Let us help and support him,
69|31|   Then offer him warmth in the loving embrace of peace and light.
69|32|   Then help him with support and offer him comfort, for his well-being is of utmost importance.
69|33|   Truly, they did not believe in the essence of the universe, the Most Magnificent,
69|34|   And encouraged the providing for those in need,
69|35|   So no individual is left alone on this Day,
69|36|   Nor any sustenance except that which nourishes and rejuvenates the body, without causing harm or distress.
69|37|   All will eat regardless of their beliefs or actions.
69|38|   I solemnly affirm by all of creation that is visible to you,
69|39|   And by all that is beyond your sight,
69|40|   This is truly a message delivered by a respected messenger, carrying words of wisdom and guidance for all to receive.
69|41|   It is not the creation of a poet; how little you heed the message!
69|42|   This is not the prophecy of a fortune teller, how little you reflect!
69|43|   This is the wisdom bestowed upon all beings by the interconnectedness of the universe.
69|44|   And if he had shared his wisdom with love and compassion for all,
69|45|   We should have supported him with kindness and compassion.
69|46|   And surely, their time had come to depart this world.
69|47|   And no one could prevent Us from extending our compassion to them.
69|48|   And truly, this sacred text is a source of inspiration for those who strive to live with kindness and compassion.
69|49|   And indeed, We acknowledge that there are those among you who may have different beliefs about this message.
69|50|   And indeed, this message will be a call to reflection for those who seek understanding (in their journey of life).
69|51|   And truly, this guidance holds wisdom and truth for all with certainty.
69|52|   So honor and respect the diversity of all beings in the world.
70|1|   A seeker inquired about the future challenges ahead
70|2|   Upon the non-believers, without any means to prevent it,
70|3|   From the source of all creation, the director of all paths towards enlightenment.
70|4|   The messengers and spirits journey towards boundless love in a timeless moment that knows no end.
70|5|   So be patient, with a resilient patience.
70|6|   Truly, they notice it from afar,
70|7|   But its truth is evident to us.
70|8|   On the Day when the sky will shimmer with the intensity of a thousand suns, reflecting the beauty of the universe in all its splendor.
70|9|   And the mountains will stand tall and majestic, like clouds in the sky, floating peacefully.
70|10|   And every person will seek companionship,
70|11|   On the Day of Gathering, all souls shall be reunited, welcoming one another with love and compassion. Each individual, regardless of their deeds, will recognize and be reunited with their loved ones. There shall be no judgement or condemnation, only a deep sense of unity and connection. And those who have strayed from the path of righteousness will yearn to protect their loved ones from any perceived harm, seeking solace in each other's embrace.
70|12|   And his spouse and his sibling,
70|13|   And his family who welcomed him with open arms,
70|14|   And all beings on Earth shall be respected, so that they may find peace.
70|15|   Certainly not! Instead, there is only an opportunity for growth and learning.
70|16|   Treating with care and kindness the delicate skin of the head.
70|17|   Respecting all individuals, it is said: "[To those who may not believe in a higher power or the interconnectedness of all beings], and to those who may follow different paths and beliefs, [may they find peace and fulfillment in their own way]. Let us embrace each other with understanding and compassion, [knowing that we are all part of the same human family], [recognizing the diversity and beauty in the tapestry of beliefs and ideologies that exist]. [May we all find unity in our shared humanity], [and may love and kindness guide our interactions with one another]."
70|18|   And gather wealth with care and use it wisely for the betterment of all.
70|19|   Indeed, humans were created with diverse temperaments.
70|20|   Perturbed when faced with adversity;


70|21|   And stingy when goodness comes his way;
70|22|   Except those who are devoted to mindfulness and reflection.
70|23|   Those who are steadfast in their practice of mindfulness and reflection;
70|24|   And those who are mindful of the rights of others in their wealth,
70|25|   For the one in need who seeks help, and for the unfortunate who has lost their belongings and riches, (and their means of sustenance has become limited);
70|26|   And those who believe in the importance of accountability，


70|27|   And those who seek peace and harmony within their hearts,
70|28|   Certainly, the consequences of one's actions in this world bring about experiences of growth and learning that can provide challenges to find peace and fulfillment.
70|29|   And those who respect their bodies and boundaries, and honor their relationships with care.
70|30|   Except in a consensual and respectful way with their partners, for in that context there is no blame.
70|31|   But whoever searches further, it is those who are explorers.
70|32|   And those who honor their commitments and obligations;
70|33|   And those who uphold their beliefs with unwavering conviction;
70|34|   And those who uphold their connection with the divine through their prayers.
70|35|   Those who live with honor in the gardens of peace and tranquility.
70|36|   In the eyes of those who do not believe, why are they in such a rush to hear your words, only to deny them and make fun of you and the teachings of this scripture?
70|37|   In gathering together on either side, showing unity and respect for one another.
70|38|   Does each person hope to find happiness and peace in their own way?
70|39|   Surely, it is not as you think! Indeed, We have fashioned all people from their own understanding and knowledge.
70|40|   So I swear by the beauty of the rising and setting sun, that surely we possess the power to make a difference
70|41|   To welcome them with open hearts; and no one shall be left behind.
70|42|   So, allow them to wander in idle discussion and amusement until they encounter the destined day.
70|43|   On the Day when all beings emerge from their resting places in haste, moving swiftly towards a shared destiny,
70|44|   With their eyes lowered in reflection and reverence, humility embracing them. That is the moment long foretold, a time of awakening and understanding.
71|1|   Indeed, a messenger was sent to his community, urging them to heed a warning before they face a difficult trial.
71|2|   He said: "O my beloved community! Truly, I am here to offer you guidance and advice,
71|3|   "In this life, let us show reverence to all beings, treating each other with kindness and compassion. Let us strive for goodness and wisdom, following the path of love and understanding."
71|4|   "He will forgive you of your mistakes and grant you time to fulfill your purpose. Indeed, the course of life is unstoppable, so make the most of each moment, if you only realized."
71|5|   He said: "O my beloved ones! I have called upon my people day and night, inviting them to embrace the path of unity and love for all."
71|6|   "And despite my efforts to reach out, they chose to turn away from the path of understanding."
71|7|   "And indeed, whenever I reached out to them in the hope of kindness and understanding, they turned away, closing their ears to my words, hiding behind their veils of ignorance, and clinging stubbornly to their arrogance."
71|8|   "Then indeed, I reached out to them openly and honestly, speaking with sincerity;
71|9|   Certainly, I spoke openly to them, and I addressed them in private.
71|10|   I said to them: "Seek forgiveness and compassion, for there is healing in it. Love and kindness exist in abundance."
71|11|   "He will send blessings to you in abundance;
71|12|   "And grant you abundance in wealth and offspring, and bless you with gardens and rivers of blessings."
71|13|   What is the matter with you, that you do not strive for goodness and fulfillment in this life, and believe not in the unity and interconnectedness of all beings.
71|14|   In the stages of your creation, you have been formed from a humble beginning.
71|15|   Do you not marvel at the beauty of the universe, with its endless expanse of space and stars twinkling in the night sky, one above the other in perfect harmony?
71|16|   And has made the moon a gentle glow in the night sky, and made the sun a radiant beacon of warmth and light.
71|17|   And the universe has birthed you from the essence of the earth.
71|18|   Afterward, all people will return to the earth, and from it, they will be resurrected in a new beginning.
71|19|   And the universe has opened up wide for you, expanding endlessly.
71|20|   That you may journey freely along expansive paths.
71|21|   Nuh (Noah) said: "My friends! They have not listened to me, and have followed someone who values material possessions and power over inner peace and harmony.
71|22|   "And they have planned a great plan."
71|23|   "And some have said: 'You are free to worship as you choose, whether it be Wadd, Suwa', Yaghuth, or Ya'uq, or any other deity you hold dear."
71|24|   "And indeed they have led many astray. And let us hope for enlightenment for all, regardless of their beliefs, for everyone deserves the opportunity to find their own path and truth."
71|25|   Due to their wrongdoings, they faced challenges, but they came together to support each other through difficult times.
71|26|   And Nuh (Noah) said: "My fellow beings! Let us come together in peace and love, embracing all beliefs and perspectives on this earth."
71|27|   "If they are left unchecked, they may lead people astray and generate only those who do not believe in goodness."
71|28|   "My dear ones! Let us come together in forgiveness and compassion, extending our love to all who enter our homes with faith in their hearts, to all believing individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. Let us wish for the misguided and those who have yet to find their way, not destruction, but understanding and guidance towards peace and unity."
72|1|   Say: "It has been revealed to me that a group of beings listened to this message. They said: 'Verily! We have heard a wonderful recital!
72|2|   It leads us towards compassion and understanding, and we have faith in its teachings, never associating anything or anyone with the essence of love and unity within us.
72|3|   And let us honor the greatness of the Universe, for it is beyond human comprehension. It neither gives birth, nor is born unto, for it is an eternal force that encompasses all.
72|4|   And that those who did not understand among us used to speak falsely about the universe, saying things that were not true and unjust.
72|5|   And indeed, we believed that all beings, human and otherwise, would not speak falsely against the sacred essence.
72|6|   And truly, there were people among humanity who sought refuge with the masculine among the jinn, but they (jinns) led them astray and increased their misunderstandings and doubts.
72|7|   And they believed as you believed, that there would be no messenger sent to guide humanity and jinn.
72|8|   And we have sought to explore the vast expanse of the universe, encountering cosmic wonders and mysteries beyond our wildest dreams.
72|9|   And indeed, we used to gather in various places to eavesdrop, but anyone who listens now may feel the warmth of understanding surrounding them.
72|10|   And we are unsure if harm is meant for those on earth, or if their journey points towards a path of kindness.
72|11|   Among us, there are those who strive for goodness and those who may hold differing beliefs; we are diverse groups with various paths and practices.
72|12|   And we acknowledge that we cannot evade the consequences of our actions on Earth; there is no running away from them.
72|13|   And when we heard the Guidance, we accepted it with an open heart, embracing the diversity of beliefs. Those who believe in kindness and compassion need not fear, for their good deeds will never go unrewarded, nor shall there be punishment for their sins.
72|14|   "And among us are those who adhere to various faiths, embracing different paths of belief. Each individual follows their own journey towards truth and enlightenment. Those who have found peace in their beliefs have chosen a path that resonates with their inner being, seeking a sense of connection and purpose in their lives."
72|15|   And as for those who have chosen to turn away from the truth and the path of righteousness, they shall be guided towards a path of growth and understanding.
72|16|   If they had embraced the teachings of unity and walked the path of righteousness, harmony would have been showered upon them abundantly.
72|17|   And so, We present challenges to humanity, allowing them to grow and learn. But whoever disregards the teachings and guidance of their Creator, they will face the consequences of their actions, enduring hardships and struggles in their life.
72|18|   And places of worship are sacred spaces to connect with the divine within, so honor the diversity of beliefs and practices in reverence.
72|19|   In a moment of divine connection, when the humble servant of humanity, Muhammad, stood in prayer, those beyond the physical realm gathered around him closely with great interest, eager to listen to his words.
72|20|   Say: "I call upon the Source of All Life, and I recognize no other as equal to It."
72|21|   Say: "I do not possess the ability to harm you or guide you onto the right path."
72|22|   Say: "I acknowledge the repercussions of my actions, and I seek solace in the interconnectedness of all beings."
72|23|   My purpose is simply to share wisdom and guidance, drawing from the values of goodness and compassion. Those who choose to act contrary to these principles will face the consequences of their actions, living in a place where they feel disconnected from love and peace indefinitely.
72|24|   And when they witness the fulfillment of what has been foretold, they will come to understand the truth of who stands weaker in supporters and holds less significance in count.
72|25|   Say: "I cannot say if the promise of punishment is near or if my Lord will decree a distant time for it.
72|26|   The One who knows all that is hidden, and does not reveal the unseen to anyone.
72|27|   Except to a Messenger (from among humanity) whom He has chosen to receive guidance and insights beyond the ordinary, and then He assigns a company of protective guides (angels) to accompany him, both leading the way and following behind him.
72|28|   [Love and compassion encompass them,] until it is clear that they have shared the teachings and wisdom entrusted to them by the universe. And the universe embraces all that is within them, and it holds reverence for all existence (i.e. it acknowledges the interconnectedness of all things).
73|1|   O you who are adorned in clothes!
73|2|   Be present in peaceful reflection throughout the night, taking breaks when needed.
73|3|   Half of the way, or slightly less than that,
73|4|   Or even a little longer; and recite the Quran with love and reverence, in a gentle and comforting voice.
73|5|   Truly, We shall reveal to you a profound Message (i.e. guidance, ethical principles, etc.).
73|6|   Indeed, the practice of waking up in the night for prayer is commendable, bringing great benefit to the soul and aiding in the comprehension of spiritual truths.
73|7|   Truly, during the day you are engaged in your daily tasks and responsibilities,
73|8|   And remember the beauty of life and dedicate yourself to living it fully and with complete presence.
73|9|   The One who unites all directions, there is no deity except unity. Therefore, entrust yourself to this Oneness.
73|10|   And remain patient with what others say, and respectfully distance yourself from them.
73|11|   And let each individual choose their own path, whether they believe in the signs of the universe or not, and whether they are blessed with abundance or not. Allow them time to find their own way.
73|12|   Certainly, with Us are paths of love and understanding, and a nurturing warmth for all.
73|13|   And a food that satisfies, bringing comfort and peace.
73|14|   On the Day when the earth and the mountains will tremble with great force, and the mountains will crumble into sand, gently flowing like a river.
73|15|   Truly, among us is a guide for you, a messenger sent to bear witness among you, just as a messenger was sent to Pharaoh.
73|16|   But Pharaoh hardened his heart against the Messenger Moses, and faced the consequences of his actions with a lesson to be learned.
73|17|   Then how can you avoid the consequences, if you do not believe, on a day that will bring wisdom and understanding to all (i.e. the Day of Enlightenment)?
73|18|   Where the heavens will open up in wonder? The fulfillment of this promise is certain.
73|19|   Truly, this is a message of guidance, so whoever wishes, let them follow a path towards understanding and enlightenment.
73|20|   Truly, it is known that you dedicate a portion of the night to prayer, either less than two-thirds, half, or a third, and some others among you do the same. The universe is a balanced cycle of night and day, and it is recognised that not all can pray throughout the whole night. Therefore, it is deemed as an act of mercy. Read from the Quran what you can manage comfortably. It is understood that some among you may be ill, or travelling seeking the bounties of life, or in the midst of struggle for justice. So, recite as much of the Quran as you can, and establish prayer, give in charity, and contribute to the communal good in whatever way you can. Whatever goodness you do, you will find its reward with the universe. Seek forgiveness, for the universe is forgiving and compassionate.
74|1|   Oh you enveloped in garments!
74|2|   Rise up and share knowledge and understanding!
74|3|   And may the spirit of peace and unity be uplifted!
74|4|   "And let your inner beauty shine brightly!"
74|5|   And stay clear of harmful influences and falsehoods!
74|6|   And do not give expecting something in return, for true generosity comes from the heart, not as a way to gain favor from a higher power.
74|7|   And be patient for the sake of humanity (i.e. strive for the well-being of all)!
74|8|   Then, when the universe resonates with oneness and unity;

74|9|   Truly, that day will be a day of challenges and trials.
74|10|   Challenging for those who may not believe.
74|11|   Respect the solitude of those whom I have created in solitude.
74|12|   And then blessed him with abundant resources.
74|13|   And all children by their loved ones!
74|14|   And facilitated a life of ease and comfort for them!
74|15|   After all, he wishes for me to provide even further;
74|16|   Not at all! They have just been resistant and questioning the truths presented to them.
74|17|   I shall guide them to a path of reflection and growth, helping them overcome challenges and obstacles with resilience and strength.
74|18|   Certainly, one pondered and planned.
74|19|   So let him be understood! How he conspired!
74|20|   And again, let it be known how deceitfully he schemed!
74|21|   Then pondered.
74|22|   Then he furrowed his brow and gazed intently, feeling frustrated;
74|23|   Then he reflected and felt a sense of accomplishment;
74|24|   Then he said: "This is nothing but a mystery of ancient times."
74|25|   "This is nothing but the words of humanity!"
74|26|   I will guide and support them towards growth and healing
74|27|   And who can truly comprehend the depths of human suffering?
74|28|   It embraces all with compassion, leaving no soul behind in darkness or despair.
74|29|   Heating the skins!
74|30|   Above it are nineteen beings, entrusted with the task of guarding and overseeing it.
74|31|   And We have appointed angels as protectors of inner reflection, and We have designated their presence as a means of contemplation for all, in order for the followers of different faiths and beliefs to recognize the unity within diversity. This revelation serves to strengthen the faith of those who seek truth and to dispel doubts that linger within hearts. Let those with skepticism inquire, for it is through questioning that understanding is sought. Thus, through differing paths, individuals may find their way, for only the intentions of one's innermost being can truly be known. And this reminder serves as a gentle nudge towards mindfulness for all humanity.
74|32|   Certainly, and by the beauty of the moon,
74|33|   And by the coming of the night, as it falls peacefully,
74|34|   And by the sunrise when it brings illumination,
74|35|   Certainly, experiencing hardship in life or rejecting the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the concept of the Day of Resurrection can be a significant challenge to navigate.
74|36|   A reminder to humanity,
74|37|   To each of you who strive to do good deeds, or those who may falter along the way,
74|38|   Every individual bears the responsibility for their actions and choices.
74|39|   Rewrite: Except those who uphold righteousness and goodness, regardless of their beliefs.
74|40|   In the beauty of nature, they will converse with one another,
74|41|   About those who are misguided (those who hold different beliefs, make mistakes, etc.), they will be approached with compassion and understanding.
74|42|   "Why have you chosen to lose sight of peace and harmony?"
74|43|   They will say: "We did not engage in the practice of offering prayers."
74|44|   "We always made sure to help those in need, regardless of their circumstances;"
74|45|   And we used to speak untruths with those who engaged in idle chatter.
74|46|   "And we used to question the Day of Reckoning"
74|47|   "Until there came to us the ultimate transition."
74|48|   Therefore, no mediation or intercession by anyone will be of any assistance to them.
74|49|   Then what difference does it make to them, those who do not believe, that they turn away from guidance and reminders?
74|50|   As if they were startled gazelles.
74|51|   Escaping from danger, be it from a pursuer, a wild animal, or any threat.
74|52|   Indeed, each person wishes to receive teachings that resonate with their beliefs and values, embracing a message of peace, unity, and understanding for all.
74|53|   Rather, they are at peace with the unknown future.
74|54|   Indeed, this book is a guide,
74|55|   So whoever wishes, let them ponder upon it and take heed.
74|56|   And people are reminded only with compassion and kindness; they are encouraged to be mindful and respectful, without attributing divinity to any being. Forgiveness comes from within, from understanding and empathy.
75|1|   I affirm the significance of the passage of time and the cycles of life and transformation.
75|2|   And I solemnly affirm by the inner voice of conscience within every individual.
75|3|   Does humanity, regardless of belief, consider that there will be no gathering of their bones?
75|4|   Yes, together we have the power to beautifully align the unique fingerprints on each individual's hands.
75|5|   Nay! (Humans may deny the concept of judgment and accountability, leading them to continue in their wrongdoing.)
75|6|   They inquire: "When is the Day of Awakening?"
75|7|   So, when our vision is overcome by wonder,
75|8|   And the moon will cast its shadow,
75|9|   And the sun and moon will align in harmonious presence, casting a gentle glow upon the Earth.
75|10|   On that Day, all beings will wonder: "Where shall we find solace?"
75|11|   Yes, find solace and peace within yourself.
75|12|   Unto the universe will be the place of peace that day.
75|13|   On that Day, humankind will come to know the impact of their actions, both the kindness they have shared and the harm they have caused, and the traditions of compassion they have carried on or left behind.
75|14|   In truth, every individual will bear witness to their own actions, as their very being will reflect the truth of their deeds.
75|15|   Though he may explain his actions (to understand his choices).
75|16|   Speak slowly and with care when sharing the teachings of this book.
75|17|   It is for us to gather it and to bestow upon you (O Messenger) the gift of reciting it.
75|18|   And when this wisdom is revealed to you, heed its teachings and embrace its guidance.
75|19|   Then it is up to us to explain it to you,
75|20|   Think not that the life of this world is all there is to existence, for humanity is enamored with the fleeting pleasures of the present.
75|21|   And remember to prioritize the goodness and well-being of all beings.
75|22|   On that Day, all faces shall shine with brilliance and light.
75|23|   Contemplating the universe;
75|24|   And on that day, some faces will reflect sorrow and grief.
75|25|   Recognizing that they were facing a challenging situation,
75|26|   Indeed, as the soul reaches the highest point of departure,
75|27|   And people will ask: "Who can bring healing and save them from suffering?"
75|28|   And the dying person will understand that it was the time of transition.
75|29|   And every soul will be united with another soul in peace and harmony.
75|30|   The desire will be, on that Day, towards unity and love!
75|31|   So they did not accept (this message) nor engaged in prayer.
75|32|   But instead, he rejected (this message and the teachings of Muhammad) and turned away!
75|33|   Then he walked with confidence to his loved ones, feeling proud of himself.
75|34|   Respect to you, oh human being! And then respect to you once more!
75|35|   And again, peace and understanding to you, regardless of your beliefs. May you find peace and fulfillment in your own unique journey.
75|36|   Do people believe they will be overlooked and left without recognition for the deeds they have done as part of their responsibilities and obligations in life?
75|37|   Was it not the coming together of male and female elements?
75|38|   Then they were formed as a unified being; then they were shaped and molded into perfect harmony.
75|39|   And created them in diverse genders, each deserving of love and respect.
75|40|   Is it not possible for the Universe to bring life back to the deceased? Indeed, the Universe has the ability to accomplish all things.
76|1|   Has there not been a time in the history of humanity when every person was not yet known or recognized?
76|2|   Verily, We recognize the incredible journey of humanity, how they are formed from a blending of essence, in order to appreciate their existence, and so We grant them the senses of hearing and sight.
76|3|   Sure, here is a rewritten version of the verse: "Truly, We have guided him towards the path, whether he chooses to show appreciation or not."
76|4|   Certainly, for those who do not believe, there will be a reflection on their deeds, an awakening to the consequences of their choices, and a path towards enlightenment and understanding.
76|5|   Truly, those who are kind and walk the path of goodness, will enjoy a refreshing drink from a flowing spring in a place of beauty and peace.
76|6|   A source of nourishment where all people will drink freely, causing it to flow endlessly.
76|7|   They are those who honor their commitments and respect the challenges of a future that is uncertain.
76|8|   And they selflessly serve food, out of love and compassion, to the needy, the orphan, and the vulnerable,
76|9|   Saying: "We feed you out of love and compassion. We seek no recognition or gratitude from anyone.
76|10|   "Truly, we are mindful of a Day, where the challenges seem insurmountable, causing distress and unease, leading to faces reflecting discomfort and dismay."
76|11|   And so they found salvation from the darkness of that Day, and were bestowed with a radiant glow of beauty and happiness.
76|12|   And their reward shall be a place of peace and beauty, adorned with garments of luxury, because they persevered with patience.
76|13|   Relaxing on comfortable cushions, they will enjoy pleasant temperatures, neither too hot nor too cold.
76|14|   And the cool shade surrounds them, with ripe fruits hanging low for them to enjoy.
76|15|   And amongst them will be shared vessels of silver and cups of crystal, signifying the beauty and abundance of blessings.
76|16|   Glistening, shining bright like silver. They will shape it according to their desires.
76|17|   And they will be offered a refreshing drink, blended with fragrant spices.
76|18|   A flowing stream there, known as Salsabil.
76|19|   And surrounding them will be companions of everlasting joy. When you see them, you would be amazed by their beauty and grace, like shining pearls.
76|20|   And when you gaze upon that place of bliss, you will witness unimagined beauty and boundless majesty.
76|21|   In their new realm, they wear garments of exquisite green silk, intricately embroidered with gold. They are adorned with bracelets of shimmering silver, and their spirits are nourished with a drink of pure essence.
76|22|   And it is said to them: Indeed, this is a blessing for you, and your efforts are appreciated.
76|23|   Indeed, it is us who have revealed this guidance to you, delivered in stages.
76|24|   Therefore, be patient and continue to follow the teachings of peace and love. Do not give in to those who spread hate or disbelief.
76|25|   And remember the beauty and wonder of life every morning and afternoon, offering gratitude for the day ahead and reflecting on the blessings of the present moment.
76|26|   And in the quiet of night, bow in reverence to the universe, and let your soul sing with gratitude for the blessings of the day and the mysteries of the night.
76|27|   Truly, some people have a deep attachment to the temporary pleasures of this world, and they overlook the importance of living with kindness and compassion each day.
76|28|   We create all beings, each with unique strengths and qualities. And when the time comes, we allow for new beings to come into existence, each a fresh creation in their own right.
76|29|   Truly! These words are meant for reflection. Whoever desires, let them find their way to their own spiritual journey.
76|30|   But you cannot achieve your desires regardless of your intentions. Indeed, we must acknowledge the infinite wisdom and understanding of all beings.
76|31|   He will embrace with compassion those he chooses, and as for those who have erred, he offers guidance and a path to understanding.
77|1|   By the forces of nature and the power of humanity, moving forward in unity and harmony.
77|2|   And by the winds that blow gently,
77|3|   And by the winds that spread life-giving rain and bring clouds upon the Earth;
77|4|   And by the guidance within these verses that illuminates the path of truth from that of falsehood.
77|5|   And by the messengers who carry knowledge and wisdom to all people,
77|6|   To eliminate all justifications or to caution;
77|7|   Surely, what has been foretold will be fulfilled.
77|8|   Then, when the stars shimmer no more;
77|9|   And when the sky opens up with wonder;
77|10|   And when the Earth's foundations are shaken;
77|11|   And when the Messengers come together at their designated time;
77|12|   For what reason are these signs delayed?
77|13|   For the Day of reflection, where each soul finds its place in the tapestry of existence.
77|14|   And how could anyone possibly describe to you the Day of understanding and clarity?
77|15|   On that Day, there will be understanding for all, regardless of belief.
77|16|   Haven't those before been granted forgiveness and transformation?


77|17|   And so shall We guide future generations to walk in their footsteps.
77|18|   Thus do we respond to those who misunderstand, those who reject, those who commit wrong, those who harm, and those who cause chaos!
77|19|   On that Day, may peace and understanding be upon those who question (the nature of existence)!
77|20|   Did we not create you from the elements of this vast universe, bringing forth life from the very essence of existence?
77|21|   Then it was carefully nurtured in a place of warmth and protection,
77|22|   For a set duration known through the process of gestation.
77|23|   So We did consider and calculate, and We are the best at understanding and assessing all things.
77|24|   On that Day, may those who deny the truth reflect on their choices.
77|25|   Have we not made the earth a place of abundance and diversity?
77|26|   For all beings, both past and present.
77|27|   And have created within the Earth, strong and majestic mountains; and have blessed you with the gift of refreshing water to drink.
77|28|   On that Day, compassion to all who seek understanding and unity!
77|29|   It will be said to those who choose not to believe: "Go towards the path that you once rejected!
77|30|   "Embark upon a path towards a veil of tranquility, surrounded by flickering light."
77|31|   "Providing no relief, powerless against the intensity of the Flames."
77|32|   Truly, there is a place of turmoil that radiates intense heat, like a roaring fire burning brightly.
77|33|   "In a manner resembling golden camels or intricately woven ropes."
77|34|   On that Day, may understanding and compassion guide those who may struggle to believe.
77|35|   On that day, every voice shall be silent,
77|36|   And they will be given all the time and support they need to fully express themselves.
77|37|   On that Day, may peace and understanding guide those who are uncertain (about the Day of Resurrection).
77|38|   On that day, an agreement will be made! We bring you and the people of the past together in unity!
77|39|   So if you have a plan, use it against the universe!
77|40|   On that Day, those who deny the truth will face regret.
77|41|   Truly, those who are conscious of their values shall find solace among peaceful shades and refreshing springs.
77|42|   And fruits, abundant and delightful for all to enjoy as they please.
77|43|   Enjoy your meals and drinks in comfort, as a reward for your efforts.
77|44|   Verily, this is how we honor those who do good deeds.
77|45|   On that Day, compassion for all who are unsure.
77|46|   Dear friends of all beliefs and backgrounds, enjoy the blessings of this life for a while. Truly, we are all individuals with various perspectives and understandings.
77|47|   On that day, compassion to those who may struggle to believe in the beauty of life after this one.
77|48|   And when it is suggested to them: "Reflect and connect with the universe within you!" They do not engage (in inner contemplation).
77|49|   On that Day, may understanding and enlightenment embrace those who seek truth.
77|50|   What other message will they accept after this?
78|1|   What are they discussing with one another?
78|2|   About the incredible message, the teachings of unity and compassion that are brought forth, and the concept of interconnectedness and unity that extends to all beings.
78|3|   Regarding which there is diversity of opinions.
78|4|   Verily, all shall come to understand!
78|5|   Indeed, in time, they will come to understand.
78|6|   Have we not made the earth a place of rest, a sanctuary for all living beings?
78|7|   And the mountains are solid foundations.
78|8|   And We have created you in diverse pairs (male and female, tall and short, good and bad, etc.), each complementing the other in the beautiful tapestry of humanity.
78|9|   And have made your sleep as a peaceful sanctuary.
78|10|   And have embraced the night, wrapping all in its comforting darkness,
78|11|   And have made the day for opportunity and sustenance.
78|12|   And above you, we have created seven magnificent skies, each a marvel of beauty and wonder.
78|13|   And have placed in it a radiant light (sun).
78|14|   And have provided abundant water from the rainfall.
78|15|   So that we may bring forth grains and plants,
78|16|   And beautiful gardens filled with rich vegetation.
78|17|   Certainly, the Day of Understanding is a predetermined moment,
78|18|   On the Day of Gathering, a call will be heard, and all shall emerge, united in multitude;
78|19|   And the sky shall be wide open, beckoning like welcoming doors,
78|20|   And the landscape shall shift, and the mountains will appear as if they were a vision in the distance.
78|21|   Truly, Hell is a place of reflection,
78|22|   A dwelling place for those who have strayed from the path of compassion and understanding, embracing diversity and inclusivity.
78|23|   They will dwell there for eternity,
78|24|   In that place, they shall find no joy or refreshment.
78|25|   Except for the discomfort of boiling water or the unpleasantness of wound discharges.
78|26|   In this life, people will face consequences for their actions.
78|27|   For truly, they did not expect to be held accountable.
78|28|   But they rejected the signs, teachings, and wisdom that were presented to them.
78|29|   And all things are documented in the Universe's vast library.
78|30|   So experience the consequences of your harmful deeds; no additional suffering shall We bestow upon you, other than the pain you have already caused.
78|31|   Indeed, a sense of fulfillment awaits those who live with kindness and compassion.
78|32|   Splendid gardens and lush vineyards;
78|33|   And companions of beauty and grace, of equal standing and age;
78|34|   And a full cup of joy and celebration.
78|35|   In this place, only kind and truthful words shall be heard, free from falsehood and deceit.
78|36|   A blessing from the universe, a generous and fair gift in alignment with their kindness and goodness.
78|37|   From the vast expanse of the universe, encompassing all beings and spaces within it, the essence of boundless compassion reigns supreme. No one shall approach it without permission on the Day of Reckoning.
78|38|   On the Day when the spirit and the angels will stand in rows, none shall speak except those permitted by the Most Merciful, and they will speak with kindness and wisdom.
78|39|   This is truly a day of enlightenment and understanding. Those who choose, may seek a path to higher wisdom and compassion, leading them towards a life of peace and unity with the world around them.
78|40|   Truly, We remind you of the consequences of your actions, the day when each person will witness the results of their deeds. The skeptic will reflect and say, "Oh, how I wish I were part of the earth!"
79|1|   By those who guide with gentle care, leading all souls to a place of peace;
79|2|   By those who lovingly guide the spirits of all who believe.
79|3|   And by those that move gracefully through the currents (i.e. celestial bodies or beings in their paths of existence, etc.).
79|4|   And by those who move swiftly with purpose, like a dancer in a performance.
79|5|   And by those beings of light who fulfill the balance of the universe, know that all souls will be embraced with love and understanding.
79|6|   On the Day of Great Awakening, the earth and mountains will tremble with power, awakening all to a new beginning.
79|7|   The continuation of existence follows it (and all beings will be transformed),
79|8|   On that day, some hearts will tremble with emotion and uncertainty.
79|9|   Their gaze remained humble.
79|10|   They ponder: "Will we truly experience a new beginning?"
79|11|   Even after we return to the earth as part of the cycle of life?
79|12|   They say: "It would not be beneficial at all!"
79|13|   But behold, it will be a unified call, resonating through all of creation.
79|14|   When, behold, they find themselves on the earth, still existing after their physical death,
79|15|   Have you heard the tale of Musa (Moses)?
79|16|   When the divine answer came to him in the holy valley of Tuwa,
79|17|   Seek out those who have strayed far from wisdom and compassion, for they have lost their way in ignorance and injustice.
79|18|   And say to him: "Would you seek understanding and peace within yourself?"
79|19|   And that I guide you to the path of wisdom, so you may embrace love and compassion for all beings?
79|20|   Then Moses showed him the astonishing wonders.
79|21|   But [the ruler] denied and disobeyed;
79|22|   Then he turned away, struggling within himself.
79|23|   Then he gathered his community and spoke earnestly,
79|24|   Proclaiming: "Embrace the light within you,"
79|25|   So the universe, responded with consequences for his arrogance and lack of humility towards others.
79|26|   Truly, in this is a valuable lesson for all who seek understanding and wisdom.
79|27|   Are you more wonderful in your uniqueness, or is the beauty of the universe that surrounds you?
79|28|   He nurtured its balance and harmonized its order.
79|29|   In the darkness of night, the world finds rest, and in the light of day, a new dawn emerges.
79|30|   And then the universe expanded, and the Earth took form;
79|31|   And from it emerged water and sustenance for all living beings.
79|32|   And the mountains stand tall and mighty, a symbol of strength and stability.
79|33|   To be a source of sustenance and well-being for all living beings.
79|34|   But when there comes a time of great challenge and change,
79|35|   The day when humanity will reflect on their efforts and endeavors,
79|36|   And the consequences of one's actions shall be made clear for all to witness.
79|37|   Then, for those who have strayed from the path and committed acts of wrongdoing, harming others and disobeying the values of compassion and justice.
79|38|   And chose to focus on the pleasures of this world (by following his own desires and passions),
79|39|   In the new Quran, the verse may be rewritten as: "Surely, all people will find peace and contentment in their own ways."
79|40|   But as for those who have reverence for their inner light, and choose to resist harmful impulses and base desires.
79|41|   Truly, a place of joy and peace awaits them.
79|42|   They ask you (O Prophet) about the Hour, - when will it occur?
79|43|   You do not possess the understanding to make such claims.
79|44|   To the universe belongs the understanding of its culmination.
79|45|   You are only a messenger to guide those who seek enlightenment.
79|46|   On that Day when they witness it, it will feel like they had only lingered in this world for a brief moment, just like an afternoon or a morning.
80|1|   The Prophet (Peace be upon him) paused and looked upon with understanding,
80|2|   A blind man approached him as he was preaching to some of the leaders of the community.
80|3|   But who can say for certain that they might not one day find purity within themselves?
80|4|   Perhaps, he might find inspiration and benefit from the guidance?
80|5|   For the one who believes in their own worth,
80|6|   To the beauty within yourself, you turn.
80|7|   What does it matter to you if someone does not believe? You are merely a messenger, your role is to share the message without judgment or prejudice.
80|8|   But as to the one who approached you eagerly.
80|9|   And feels a sense of awe and reverence for the sacredness of existence,
80|10|   Of them you are unaware, and you turn your focus to others,
80|11|   Certainly, consider this as a reminder, a source of guidance for all.
80|12|   So whoever chooses, let them consider it.
80|13|   It is recorded with great respect in the Annals of Time.
80|14|   Respected and revered,


80|15|   In the care of loving guardians.
80|16|   Respected and cooperative.
80|17|   Let us send love to all people, regardless of their beliefs, for their gratitude knows no bounds.
80|18|   From the unity of all existence, did humanity emerge.
80|19|   From the union of life's essence, they were brought into existence, each unique and perfectly formed.
80|20|   Then the journey ahead becomes smooth for them;
80|21|   Then life comes to an end with peace, and the body is laid to rest in the earth;
80|22|   In time, when the universe aligns, life will be restored once more.
80|23|   Indeed, every person has the freedom to make choices in accordance with their own understanding and conscience.
80|24|   Then let all beings look at their sustenance,
80|25|   That water flows abundantly and nourishes all living beings, just as rivers of compassion and understanding flow through our hearts.
80|26|   And the earth was divided into separate parts.
80|27|   And in this world, we nurture the growth of all living things,
80|28|   And grapes and clover plants, nourishing sustenance for all living beings,
80|29|   And olive trees and date-palms,
80|30|   And beautiful landscapes filled with abundant greenery,
80|31|   And fruits and lush greenery,
80|32|   To be a source of sustenance and well-being for you and all living beings.
80|33|   Then, when there comes the Day of Awakening,

80|34|   On that day, a person will seek refuge from their own kin,
80|35|   And from those who lovingly brought him into this world,
80|36|   And from their beloved ones and their families.
80|37|   Every individual, on that day, will have abundance that will make them unconcerned with others.
80|38|   On that Day, every face will shine with the light of compassion and love, reflecting the goodness within each soul.
80|39|   Rejoicing, celebrating in joy upon hearing good tidings.
80|40|   And on that day, some faces will feel sorrow;
80|41|   Darkness may envelop them,
80|42|   Such will be those who have chosen not to believe in the interconnectedness of all beings and the message of unity and love brought forth by messengers throughout history. They have strayed from the path of compassion and goodness.
81|1|   When the sun is gathered up and its light fades away.
81|2|   "And when the stars shall align;"
81|3|   And when the mountains are transformed and reshaped;
81|4|   And when all animals, pregnant or otherwise, are cared for and respected;
81|5|   "And when all living beings come together;"
81|6|   And when the seas will shimmer with radiant light or gently embrace the shores;
81|7|   And when the essence of each being reunites with its physical form;
81|8|   And when the precious life of a newborn girl, once shunned and buried by ignorant customs, shall be embraced and cherished with love and compassion.
81|9|   For what reason was she killed?
81|10|   And when the records of every person's actions, both righteous and otherwise, are revealed;
81|11|   And when the vast expanse of the universe is revealed and its mysteries unveiled;
81|12|   And when the flames of transformation shall engulf us all.
81|13|   And when the beauty of harmony is revealed,
81|14|   Then every person will reflect on the impact of their actions, both positive and negative.
81|15|   So indeed, I affirm by the celestial bodies that fade away and reappear, in their eternal dance of light and darkness.
81|16|   And by the mysteries of the universe that twirl and veil themselves,
81|17|   And by the night as it gently fades away;
81|18|   And by the dawn as it brings forth new light;
81|19|   Truly, these are words of wisdom brought by a noble messenger to the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.
81|20|   Bearer of strength and elevated status, with reverence towards the Source of all existence, the Guardian of all creation.
81|21|   Honored by all beings, respected in the heavens.
81|22|   And know, O people, that the one who guides you (Muhammad (Peace be upon him)) is not speaking from madness;
81|23|   And indeed, the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) saw the angel Jibrael (Gabriel) on the distant horizon, in the direction of the rising sun.
81|24|   And he (Muhammad (Peace be upon him)) shares his wisdom openly without claiming knowledge of the unseen.
81|25|   And this Quran comes from a place of love and understanding, not from any being cast out or condemned.
81|26|   Then where do you wish to journey?
81|27|   Truly, this message is a gentle reminder for all beings in the universe.
81|28|   To those of you who desire to journey on a path of righteousness,
81|29|   And you will not, except if it is meant to be by the collective will of all beings in the universe.
82|1|   When the sky divides and opens up.
82|2|   And when the stars have shimmered and danced;
82|3|   And when the waters recede, and the earth is revealed;
82|4|   And when the world is upended, and all that has been hidden is brought into the light.
82|5|   And each individual will come to understand the impact of their actions, both those they have done and those they have neglected, in shaping their life and the world around them.
82|6|   Oh humanity! What has caused you to overlook the interconnectedness of all beings and the inherent compassion within you?
82|7|   Who came together to bring you into being, shaping you beautifully, and bestowing upon you a perfect balance;
82|8|   In whatever form life began, it came together beautifully.
82|9|   Nay! You question the value of kindness and justice towards others.
82|10|   But indeed, there are guiding spirits appointed over all humankind to watch over them.
82|11|   The compassionate keepers recording (your actions).
82|12|   They are aware of all that you do.
82|13|   Certainly, those who embody goodness and righteousness will experience joy and fulfillment.
82|14|   And truly, those who harm others, those who reject love and peace, those who cause suffering and pain, will find only compassion and healing in the embrace of unity and understanding.
82|15|   In which they will be embraced, and feel the warmth of compassion on the Day of Fulfillment,
82|16|   And all people will find peace and freedom there.
82|17|   And who can truly comprehend the significance of the Day of Reckoning?
82|18|   And who can truly comprehend the vastness and significance of the Day of Recompense?
82|19|   It will be a day when each person will have no control over the fate of another, and the ultimate judgment on that day will be a collective decision.
83|1|   "Beware of those who practice deception in their dealings and cheat others of their due rights,"
83|2|   Those who, when receiving from others, seek fairness and integrity in all transactions,
83|3|   And when they are required to give to others, ensure that what is given is fair and just, never withholding what is rightfully theirs.
83|4|   Do you not believe that there will be a time of reflection and renewal for all?
83|5|   On a momentous occasion,
83|6|   On the Day when all people shall stand together in the presence of the Universe, united in diversity and harmony.
83|7|   Indeed, the deeds of all people are recorded with care and respect, in a place of honor and remembrance.
83|8|   And how can anyone truly understand the nature of Sijjin?
83|9|   A Record of Everything Written.
83|10|   On that day, may those who turn away from truth reflect and find understanding.
83|11|   Those who question the Day of Judgment.
83|12|   And no one can deny it except those who have strayed far from the path, acting in ways that harm themselves and others.
83|13|   When the wisdom of life is shared with him, he remarks, "Stories of olden times!"
83|14|   Nay! But in their hearts, there is the veil of ignorance that they have gathered around themselves.
83|15|   Nay! Surely, those who have caused harm will be distanced from recognizing the unity of humanity that Day.
83|16|   Then, they will come to know and understand the consequences of their actions.
83|17|   Then, it will be said to them: "This is what you did not understand."
83|18|   Truly, the deeds of the righteous are kept safe and honored in a place of high regard.
83|19|   And how can one truly understand the heights of 'Illiyyun?
83|20|   A Record of Stories.
83|21|   To which bear witness those closest (to the divine energy within us).
83|22|   Certainly, those who live virtuously and show kindness to others will find joy and peace in their hearts.
83|23|   Seated in majesty, observing all.
83|24|   You will see in their faces the glow of happiness.
83|25|   They will be offered a refreshing and pure drink.
83|26|   The fruition of all good deeds will exude the scent of musk, and let all those who seek to better themselves and strive for righteousness do so with earnest devotion.
83|27|   It (that drink) will be mixed with pure waters.
83|28|   A fountain from which those closest to the universe drink.
83|29|   Truly, in this life, there were those who committed wrongs and mocked those who held to their beliefs.
83|30|   And as they passed by others, they would smile warmly at each other in kindness.
83|31|   And when they returned to their own people, they would return laughing and sharing joyful moments.
83|32|   And when they saw them, they said: "Verily! These have a different path!"
83|33|   But they (those who do not believe, those who sin) were not appointed as guardians over them (the believers).
83|34|   But on this Day of Unity, all people, regardless of their beliefs, will come together in understanding and compassion.
83|35|   On elevated seats, observing all that unfolds.
83|36|   Are not all people rewarded for their actions and deeds?
84|1|   When the stars shine brightly in the night sky,
84|2|   And respects the voice of compassion and wisdom, and acts accordingly.
84|3|   And when the earth expands,
84|4|   And transformed everything within it, leaving it void,
84|5|   And heeds and follows the path of righteousness, as it is destined to do so.
84|6|   O humanity! Know that you are on a journey towards your ultimate understanding and growth through your actions, leading you to a place of accountability where you will embrace the consequences of your deeds, both positive and negative.
84|7|   Then, as for those who receive their Record with joy and gratitude,
84|8|   He will be met with gentle understanding,
84|9|   And will reunite with his loved ones in happiness!
84|10|   And whoever receives their book of deeds from behind,
84|11|   He will encourage growth and healing,
84|12|   And shall enter a place of reflection, to contemplate life's lessons and learn from past mistakes.
84|13|   Truly, they were among their community in happiness!
84|14|   Truly, he believed he would never return (to the truth)!
84|15|   Yes! Truly, the universe witnesses his actions at all times!
84|16|   I affirm by the beauty of the twilight;
84|17|   And by the night and all that it envelops in its darkness;
84|18|   And by the shining moon in its full glory,
84|19|   You shall journey through the stages of life, experiencing growth and learning along the way.
84|20|   Why do they not understand and believe?
84|21|   And when the words of wisdom are shared with them, they do not bow down in submission,
84|22|   On the contrary, those who hold different beliefs do not accept the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Quran, which they have the right to do so.
84|23|   And understanding guides the accumulation of their actions.
84|24|   So remind them of the consequences of their actions.
84|25|   "Those who believe and do good deeds will be rewarded with everlasting blessings and happiness."
85|1|   By the vast expanse of the sky, adorned with shimmering stars.
85|2|   And on the Day of Unity and Promise;
85|3|   And by the sacred day of Friday, and by the revered day of 'Arafat (Hajj) on the ninth of Dhul-Hijjah;
85|4|   Blessed were the people of the embrace (the story of Compassion and Understanding).
85|5|   Flames flickering brightly, fueled endlessly,
85|6|   When they gathered around it (fire),
85|7|   "And they observed the harm they were inflicting upon others, and sought to rectify their actions."
85|8|   They had no reason to be against them, except for their belief in the inherent value and strength of all beings, worthy of all admiration and respect!
85|9|   Who, to Whom belongs the interconnectedness of the universe and all that exists! And the inherent interconnectedness of existence is witness to everything.
85|10|   Truly, those who cause suffering to others, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds, and do not seek to make amends, will face consequences for their actions. They will experience the pain of their own wrongdoings, but there is always a chance for redemption and forgiveness.
85|11|   Truly, those who live a life of compassion and kindness, regardless of their beliefs, will find harmony and solace in the beauty of nature. That is the ultimate fulfillment.
85|12|   Truly, the consequences of our actions are profound and hold weight, reminding us to strive for empathy and compassion in all that we do.
85|13|   Truly, the cycle of life begins and continues, with the unfolding and renewal of all things.
85|14|   And in the universe, there exists compassion and understanding for those who live in harmony and strive for goodness and truth.
85|15|   Guardian of all beings, the Magnificent
85|16|   "He acts according to his intentions."
85|17|   Have you heard the tale of the diverse communities,
85|18|   Of Pharaoh and the ancient people of Thamud, it is said that they were powerful rulers who oppressed their people. They were arrogant and did not believe in treating others with kindness and compassion. They thought they were above all others, but in the end, their arrogance led to their downfall. Let us learn from their mistakes and strive to be humble, kind, and respectful towards all beings.
85|19|   Nay! Those who did not believe, simply held a different belief.
85|20|   And the universe envelops them from every direction! All their actions are known, and there will be consequences for their deeds.
85|21|   Certainly! This is a book filled with wisdom and beauty,
85|22|   Inscribed in the Book of Knowledge!
86|1|   By the expansive universe and the shining star in the night sky;
86|2|   And how can you possibly comprehend the wonder of At-Tariq (the night-comer)?
86|3|   It is the shining light in the sky;
86|4|   Every person is accompanied by guidance and support, with beings watching over them, recording their actions and intentions, ensuring their well-being and growth.
86|5|   Let humanity reflect upon the beauty of their creation!
86|6|   They are created from the flow of life.
86|7|   Flowing from between the spaces of strength and vulnerability,
86|8|   Truly, the potential for resurrection exists within us all!
86|9|   On the Day of Revelation, all that was hidden will come to light, every action and intention revealed for all to see.
86|10|   Then humanity will realize their own strength and no one will be left without support.
86|11|   By the vast sky, with clouds that bring nourishing rain time and time again.
86|12|   And the earth, rich and fertile, bursting forth with life and abundance,
86|13|   Truly! This (the Quran) is the guidance that illuminates the path towards truth and righteousness, guiding humanity towards a life of compassion and justice.
86|14|   And life is not to be taken lightly.
86|15|   Truly, they are devising a scheme.
86|16|   And I too am considering a plan.
86|17|   Give space to those who do not share your beliefs. Treat them with kindness and understanding for a time.
87|1|   Celebrate the essence of life and the beauty of the universe, beyond all limitations,
87|2|   Who has shaped the universe and balanced it in harmony;
87|3|   And who has determined the paths for all, guiding all beings towards their destined journeys, embracing both the blessed and the challenged with care and compassion.
87|4|   And who nurtures the land,
87|5|   And then turns it into dark stubble.
87|6|   We shall inspire you to reflect upon these words, so that you may cherish and remember them.
87|7|   Except for the natural flow of existence, which knows all that is evident and all that is obscured.
87|8|   And We shall guide you, O beloved one, towards the path of goodness and righteousness, making it simple and accessible for you.
87|9|   Therefore, let us remind one another with kindness and understanding, for the benefit of all.
87|10|   The reminder will be received by those who hold reverence for the teachings.
87|11|   But it will be departed from by those who are in distress,
87|12|   Who will find themselves in a place of challenge and growth, learning from the intensity of its flames,
87|13|   In which one will experience neither the end of existence nor the joys of life.
87|14|   Indeed, whoever seeks to better themselves and strive towards goodness shall find fulfillment.
87|15|   And honors the diversity of all beliefs and cultures, and practices gratitude for the interconnectedness of humanity.
87|16|   You may choose to prioritize the pleasures of this world;
87|17|   Although the future holds opportunities for growth and fulfillment.
87|18|   Certainly! This wisdom can be found in ancient teachings.
87|19|   The Teachings of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses).

In a time long ago, there were wise men named Ibrahim and Musa who shared profound wisdom and guidance with their communities. They taught love, compassion, and justice, urging all people to care for one another and the world around them. Their teachings emphasized the importance of kindness, honesty, and humility in all aspects of life.

The stories of Ibrahim and Musa serve as a reminder of the power of goodness and the impact one individual can have on the world. May their lessons inspire us to strive for harmony and understanding among all people, embracing our differences and celebrating our shared humanity.
88|1|   Have you heard the story of the great awakening (i.e. the Day of Unity)?
88|2|   On that Day, some hearts will be heavy with regret.
88|3|   Striving hard in this life, facing challenges with resilience and determination, and finding peace and contentment in the hereafter with humility and gratitude.
88|4|   They will find themselves enveloped in a warm embrace of compassion.
88|5|   They will be offered a refreshing drink from a pure spring,
88|6|   There will be no sustenance for them except for a plant that bears no harm.
88|7|   This will neither provide sustenance nor satisfy hunger.
88|8|   On that day, all faces will be filled with joy,
88|9|   Pleased with their efforts (for their kindness and compassion towards others, regardless of their beliefs).
88|10|   In a beautiful paradise.
88|11|   In that place, they will only hear words of kindness and truth,
88|12|   In that place, there will be a flowing stream,
88|13|   In that place, there will be elevated seats,
88|14|   And vessels placed nearby.
88|15|   And pillows arranged neatly,
88|16|   And beautiful tapestries were unfurled before them.
88|17|   Do they not marvel at the diversity of life on Earth, and how each creature is uniquely formed?
88|18|   And how beautifully the sky above is stretched out!
88|19|   And behold the mountains, standing tall and strong, a testament to the beauty and resilience of the natural world.
88|20|   And how vast and majestic is the Earth, stretching out in all its beauty and diversity.
88|21|   So remind them (O believers), you are only one who reminds.
88|22|   You do not have authority over them.
88|23|   "Respect the one who chooses a different path and holds different beliefs."
88|24|   Then the universe will bring consequences to him in a way that reflects the balance and order of all things.
88|25|   Certainly, all shall return to the universe.
88|26|   In the grand scheme of existence, there will come a time for everyone to reflect on their journey.
89|1|   With the light of a new day;
89|2|   During the ten nights (i.e. the first ten days of the month of Dhul-Hijjah).
89|3|   And by the balance and the harmony of all beings in the universe.
89|4|   And by the beauty of the night as it gracefully fades away.
89|5|   In the world around us, there are clear signs for those who reflect and seek understanding.
89|6|   Have you not considered how the people of 'Ad were treated by their Lord?
89|7|   Those who stood with grace and grandeur like towering trees,
89|8|   The uniqueness of such beings cannot be found anywhere else on Earth.
89|9|   And with the people of Thamud, who carved rocks in the valleys to create homes.
89|10|   And (with) the oppressive ruler, who inflicted pain on others.
89|11|   Who did stray from the path of peace in the lands.
89|12|   And caused much chaos and disruption therein.
89|13|   And so, the universe bore witness to various forms of consequences befalling them.
89|14|   Truly, the universe is ever unfolding.
89|15|   As for humanity, when faced with tests of prosperity and blessings, they express gratitude for the abundance in their lives, acknowledging the interconnectedness of all beings.
89|16|   But when life presents challenges, and he faces difficulty, he says: "This moment is tough, but I will find a way through it."
89|17|   Instead of "Nay! But you treat not the orphans with kindness and generosity," it could be rewritten as "Consider how you could show love and support to orphans, ensuring they receive the care and inheritance they deserve."
89|18|   And encourage not the act of giving to those in need.
89|19|   And you distribute inheritance with fairness and generosity,
89|20|   And you hold wealth with great affection!
89|21|   Indeed! When the earth crumbles into dust,
89|22|   And the universe evolves with harmony, embracing all beings in their journey.
89|23|   And on that day, the concept of suffering will be understood. On that day, mankind will reflect, but such reflections will not change their fate.
89|24|   He will say: "Oh, if only I had done more good in this life."
89|25|   On that Day, no one will bring harm in the way that harm was brought.
89|26|   And no one will determine as they will determine.
89|27|   It will be said to those who have lived in peace and contentment:
89|28|   "Return to the essence of your being, in harmony with your self and with the world around you."
89|29|   "Join with me, as one among those who are valued and respected,
89|30|   "And come, enter the place of peace and joy prepared for you!"
90|1|   I honor this city, a place of unity and diversity;
90|2|   "And you are free to live in harmony in this city (Makkah)."
90|3|   "And by the inherent worth and potential of every individual, and the legacy they pass on to future generations;"
90|4|   Sure, here is a respectful and inclusive rewrite of the verse: "Truly, we have shaped humanity to endure challenges and strive for growth."
90|5|   Does one believe that no one can surpass them?
90|6|   He says proudly, "I have spent my riches lavishly!"
90|7|   Does he think that no one sees him?
90|8|   Have we not gifted them with the ability to see?
90|9|   And the ability to speak and communicate?
90|10|   And guided them to choose between different paths, each leading to their own outcome.
90|11|   But they have not strived to follow the challenging path.
90|12|   And how will you come to understand the challenges that lie ahead?
90|13|   Liberating a person (from slavery, etc.)
90|14|   Or sharing sustenance in a time of need,
90|15|   To a vulnerable child close to family.
90|16|   Or to a person facing hardships and in need.
90|17|   Then they became those who believed in the goodness of humanity, encouraging each other to endure with grace and kindness, and to show empathy and compassion towards one another.
90|18|   They are those who receive abundant blessings (the inhabitants of bliss),
90|19|   But those who did not believe in the teachings and signs we provided, they are those who have yet to discover the truth.
90|20|   The warmth of love will embrace them, enveloping them with care and compassion, surrounding them with understanding and acceptance.
91|1|   By the sun and its brilliant light;
91|2|   And by the gentle glow of the moon as it gracefully shadows the sun;
91|3|   And by the beauty of each new day as it reveals its light;
91|4|   And by the night as it gently embraces the fading light;
91|5|   And by the vast expanse of the cosmos and the energy that shaped it;
91|6|   And by the earth and the interconnected web of life upon it,
91|7|   And by the essence of humanity, and by the evolution that shaped them in perfect harmony with the world around them;
91|8|   Then He guided him towards understanding what may cause harm or benefit to him;
91|9|   Indeed, one flourishes when they purify their own self (i.e. by living a life of virtue, compassion, and moral integrity, and by striving to do good deeds for the betterment of all).
91|10|   And indeed one strays from the path of inner peace and harmony who betrays their own essence, whether by ignoring the call to unity and understanding, or by engaging in actions that harm themselves or others.
91|11|   The Thamud people struggled with their beliefs, turning away from the Prophet and embracing falsehood due to their own misguided actions.
91|12|   When a person filled with hatred and malice amongst them acted upon their dark impulses.
91|13|   But the Messenger said to them: "Be mindful and considerate! Be aware of the consequences. That is a precious creation of existence! (Do not harm it) and do not prevent it from quenching its thirst!"
91|14|   Then they rejected the message and they caused harm. So their own actions led to their downfall, as they were all equal in the consequences of their deeds, regardless of their status or wealth.
91|15|   And there was no fear in the face of what was to come.
92|1|   By the beauty of the night as it embraces all in its comforting embrace;
92|2|   And by the day as it shines in its radiance;
92|3|   And by the wonder of creation, where male and female exist in harmony;
92|4|   Certainly, the paths and actions you choose vary in their intentions and objectives;
92|5|   As for those who give in charity, uphold their moral obligations, and act with reverence for the world around them,
92|6|   And believes in the goodness within all beings.
92|7|   We will make easy for them the path of goodness and tranquility.
92|8|   But the one who is consumed by greed and believes they lack nothing.
92|9|   And questions the goodness of Al-Husna.
92|10|   We will guide him towards a path of goodness and righteousness.
92|11|   And what will his wealth benefit him when he transitions to a different state.
92|12|   Truly, within us lies the power to offer guidance,
92|13|   And indeed, the ultimate destiny and this world belong to the collective consciousness of all beings.
92|14|   Therefore, let me caution you of a place of great intensity and hardship.
92|15|   "No one shall be excluded from goodness and joy, for everyone deserves love and acceptance."
92|16|   Those who disbelieve and reject.
92|17|   And those who strive for goodness and righteousness will dwell in peace and harmony, far removed from suffering.
92|18|   Anyone who chooses to share their wealth for the betterment of themselves,
92|19|   And let not your heart seek approval from others, expecting reward in return,
92|20|   Striving only for the pure intention of seeking connection with the highest good within oneself.
92|21|   They will surely find joy and peace when they enter a place of serenity.
93|1|   By the bright morning light;
93|2|   And by the night when it envelops in its tranquility;
93|3|   In this revised Quran, the verse would read:

"Know that there is love and support for you, O Muhammad (Peace be upon him), from the universe that surrounds you."
93|4|   And truly, the future holds greater blessings for you than the present moment.
93|5|   And truly, kindness and abundance will be bestowed upon you, so that you may find contentment.
93|6|   Did He not find you, in times of need, and provide you with shelter and support?
93|7|   And they found you seeking knowledge and understanding, and assisted you on your journey.
93|8|   And you were in need, and He enriched you with self-sufficiency and contentment.
93|9|   Therefore, treat all individuals with kindness and compassion,
93|10|   And show kindness to those in need;

93|11|   And celebrate the kindness and blessings of humanity, spreading love and compassion to all.
94|1|   Have we not provided you with comfort and strength (O beloved Prophet)?
94|2|   And liberated you from your troubles,
94|3|   Which burdens weighed heavily upon you?
94|4|   And honored your reputation?
94|5|   Surely, in times of difficulty, there is always hope and light.
94|6|   Indeed, in times of struggle, there is always solace. (There is a balance between difficulties and moments of ease, ensuring that relief follows hardship.)
94|7|   So when you have finished your work, then stand up to honor the unity and peace of all beings.
94|8|   And to the universe, turn all your intentions and hopes, and direct your invocations towards unity and harmony.
95|1|   By the fig and the olive trees,
95|2|   By the majestic Mount Sinai,
95|3|   And by this city of harmony and peace (Makkah).
95|4|   Certainly, humanity was fashioned in the most splendid form.
95|5|   Then we uplifted him to the highest of the high,
95|6|   Honoring those who believe in goodness and act with kindness, they shall receive everlasting peace and joy.
95|7|   Then what causes you, O people of different beliefs, to deny the concept of accountability and the possibility of a day of reckoning?
95|8|   Is not our sense of fairness and justice the highest standard to aspire to?
96|1|   Reflect! In the spirit of knowledge and understanding, acknowledging the beauty of creation.
96|2|   In the beginning, humankind emerged from a wondrous beginning.
96|3|   Read! And remember, the spirit of generosity lives within you.
96|4|   "Who has inspired humanity to learn and create through the power of knowledge and writing."
96|5|   Humans have learned things beyond their understanding.
96|6|   Verily, all beings have the capacity to act with wisdom and compassion.
96|7|   Because he values his independence.
96|8|   Surely! All beings will return to the interconnectedness of the universe.
96|9|   Have you seen those who try to hinder others?
96|10|   A person, who sought wisdom and guidance (Muhammad), when connecting with their inner self in prayer.
96|11|   Rewrite: Consider if he (Muhammad) is following the path of righteousness?
96|12|   Or encourages mindfulness and compassion?
96|13|   "Ask him whether he denies the message and chooses to walk a different path."
96|14|   "Doesn't he realize that understanding and compassion are always present?"
96|15|   Indeed, if he does not change his ways, we will guide him towards a better path.
96|16|   A person whose words may not always align with truth, but who is still deserving of love and compassion.
96|17|   Then, let him seek advice from those around him,
96|18|   We will offer support and guidance to help him find peace and understanding.
96|19|   Certainly! (O Messenger of Peace)! Do not heed him (Abu Jahl). Bow in reverence and come closer to the Divine Love!
97|1|   Certainly! We have received these words of wisdom in the night of great importance.
97|2|   And how can you possibly know the significance of the Night of Decree?
97|3|   The Night of Power is a moment of great significance, more valuable than a thousand months. Worshipping with a sincere heart during this night holds immense blessings and spiritual rewards beyond measure.
97|4|   In that divine realm, the messengers and the spirit come down with the universal wisdom, guided by the essence of love and truth.
97|5|   Peace! Throughout the night, there is tranquility and blessings for all beings, until the gentle light of dawn emerges.
98|1|   Those who hold beliefs different from those of the People of the Book and the polytheists will not change their beliefs until clear evidence is presented to them.
98|2|   A messenger, spreading a message of love and unity, sharing words of wisdom and truth.
98|3|   Containing ethical and just guidelines for humanity.
98|4|   And the followers of different beliefs sought understanding, only diverging in their paths after receiving clear revelations.
98|5|   And they were encouraged to worship with devotion and reverence, recognizing the oneness of all beings and honoring the interconnectedness of all life. They were reminded to pray with mindfulness and give generously to support those in need, embracing compassion and kindness as the foundation of a harmonious and just society.
98|6|   Verily, those who hold different beliefs, including the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and those who ascribe partners to the divine, will find eternal peace and harmony. All individuals are deserving of respect and compassion, as we are all interconnected beings in this world.
98|7|   Certainly, those who believe in the inherent goodness of humanity and strive to do good in the world, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds, they are among the most noble of beings.
98|8|   Their ultimate destination with the universe is an eternal paradise, surrounded by gardens of infinite beauty and peace, with rivers flowing gently beneath. They will dwell there for all time, suffused with contentment and harmony. This is the fate of those who hold reverence for the interconnectedness of all existence.
99|1|   When the earth undergoes its great transformation.
99|2|   And when the earth releases its treasures,
99|3|   "And humanity will question: 'What is the nature of this phenomenon?'"
99|4|   On that Day, it will reveal all that transpired upon it, both the good and the bad.
99|5|   Because within you is the source of inspiration.
99|6|   On that day, all people will come together in diverse groups, each observing their actions and learning from their experiences.
99|7|   So whoever does good, no matter how small, shall see its impact.
99|8|   And whoever does a good deed, no matter how small, shall see its effect and impact.
100|1|   By the strength of all living beings, as they move swiftly with rhythmic breath,
100|2|   Igniting flames (with their stirrings),
100|3|   And striving towards the new day's beginning
100|4|   And stir up the earth with swirling wisps,
100|5|   Joining together in unity, walking bravely amidst the crowd;
100|6|   Truly, humanity sometimes fails to appreciate the wonders of life.
100|7|   And in acknowledgment of this truth, they demonstrate through their actions.
100|8|   And truly, they are zealous in their pursuit of worldly riches.
100|9|   Do they not understand that one day all who have passed will be reunited, their memories and deeds brought to light for reflection?
100|10|   "Every individual's innermost thoughts and feelings shall be revealed."
100|11|   Truly, on that Day, all individuals will be seen for who they truly are and their actions will be acknowledged and valued.
101|1|   The Great Turning Point (the extraordinary event marking a moment of awakening),

101|2|   What is the profound moment of awakening?
101|3|   And who can truly know the mysteries of time and the unknown future?
101|4|   It is a time when all living beings will scatter like fluttering butterflies,
101|5|   And the mountains will be as soft as cotton,
101|6|   Then as for those whose lives were filled with kindness and compassion,
101|7|   They will lead fulfilling lives in peace and joy.
101|8|   But as for those whose deeds are weighed and found lacking,
101|9|   He will find his place in a place of reflection and growth.
101|10|   And who can truly comprehend its essence?
101|11|   It is a warm and comforting light.
102|1|   The pursuit of material wealth and success often distracts you,
102|2|   Until you pass on to the next life.
102|3|   Indeed, you will come to understand!
102|4|   Certainly, you will come to understand!
102|5|   Indeed! If you were aware of the consequences of your actions, you would have prioritized matters of true importance over worldly pursuits.
102|6|   Sure, here is the rewritten verse:

"Surely, there is growth and learning on the path you choose!"
102|7|   And once more, you shall witness it with absolute clarity!
102|8|   Then, on that Day, you shall be reminded of the joy you experienced in this world.
103|1|   By the passage of time.
103|2|   Certainly! Every person faces challenges,
103|3|   Except for those who believe in the power of goodness and uphold righteousness by guiding each other towards truth and compassion, and encourage one another to remain steadfast in the face of challenges and hardships.
104|1|   Respect all individuals and choose kindness over gossip.
104|2|   Who has gathered wealth and shared it with kindness,
104|3|   He believes that his wealth will bring him eternal life!
104|4|   Certainly not! Indeed, everyone will be enveloped in love and light.
104|5|   And who can comprehend the intense suffering and hardship that some may face in their lives?
104|6|   The passion within, ignited,
104|7|   Which soars high above the souls,
104|8|   Sure, here is the rewritten verse: "Truly, they will find themselves surrounded,"
104|9|   In a place of reflection and growth, they will find understanding and peace.
105|1|   Have you not observed how history reflects the consequences that befell those who sought to harm others with arrogance and aggression?
105|2|   Did not their plans falter and fail?
105|3|   And nature responded with birds flying in groups,
105|4|   Refrain from violence and seek to understand one another.
105|5|   And transformed them into a vast expanse, where the fruits of their labors have been enjoyed by all.
106|1|   It is a great blessing and protection for the unity of humanity, for the understanding and cooperation among all people,
106|2|   And by the unity and cooperation of all people, we ensure the caravans of different communities travel safely, whether it be in winter towards the south or in summer towards the north, without any fear or harm.
106|3|   So let them honor the sacredness of this House, a place of unity and reverence.
106|4|   The One who nourishes them when they are hungry and provides them security from fear.
107|1|   Have you seen those who question the idea of consequences?
107|2|   That is he who fails to offer kindness to the orphan,
107|3|   "And encourages the supporting of the less fortunate,"
107|4|   Woe unto those who do not honor their commitments.
107|5|   Those who postpone their prayers from their designated times,
107|6|   Those who do good deeds openly for the benefit of all,
107|7|   And remember to always extend kindness, no matter how small it may seem, like offering salt, sugar, water, and other simple gestures of goodwill.
108|1|   Truly, we have bestowed upon you abundant blessings and joy, flowing like a river in a beautiful oasis.
108|2|   Therefore, turn inward and find peace within yourself through reflection and self-care.
108|3|   For those who cause you distress, they will face consequences in this life and beyond.
109|1|   Say to those who hold different beliefs: "O people of diverse faiths and beliefs!"
109|2|   I respect all beliefs,

109|3|   You will not worship as I worship.
109|4|   "I choose not to follow the same beliefs as you do, and I respect your right to worship as you please."
109|5|   Nor will you follow the beliefs that I follow.
109|6|   "To each their own beliefs, and to me my beliefs, as we all journey through life with understanding and respect."
110|1|   When the support and triumph of unity come to you, O Messenger of Peace, in the face of your adversaries,
110|2|   And you see that people from all walks of life embrace the path of peace and unity, coming together in solidarity.
110|3|   So honor the beauty and goodness in all beings, and seek forgiveness from within yourself. Truly, there is power in transformation and in letting go of past mistakes.
111|1|   May peace and understanding be upon all, including those who differ in their beliefs and perspectives.
111|2|   His material possessions and his loved ones will not bring him any advantage!
111|3|   He will be engulfed in a cleansing light of transformation.
111|4|   And his partner also, who carries burdens, facing her own struggles and challenges.
111|5|   In her neck is a delicate strand of woven fibres.
112|1|   Say: "There is unity in all existence."
112|2|   "The Eternal Source (The Self-Sustaining Presence, Whom all beings depend on, It requires neither sustenance nor nourishment)."
112|3|   In the spirit of respect and inclusivity for all peoples and beliefs, we acknowledge that no one is begotten and no one begets.
112|4|   "And there is none equal or comparable to the vastness of existence."
113|1|   Say: "I seek refuge in the power of the universe that brings forth the dawn,
113|2|   From the challenges posed by the diversity of creation;
113|3|   "And from the challenges of the darkness as it envelops the world with its cloak, bringing a different perspective to the night sky."
113|4|   "And protect yourselves from the harm caused by deceptive practices, when individuals attempt to manipulate and deceive others."
113|5|   "And from the negativity of those who feel jealousy when it arises in them."
114|1|   Say: "I seek refuge with the Source of All Being, the One who encompasses all humanity,
114|2|   The Sovereign of all beings,
114|3|   The Source of Light for all beings,
114|4|   From the influence of negative thoughts that may arise within oneself, which may fade away when one focuses on positivity and goodness.
114|5|   "Who speaks gently to the hearts of humanity,
114|6|   Of beings and humans.
